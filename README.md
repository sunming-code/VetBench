VetBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Veterinary Large Language Models<div align="center"></div>📖 IntroductionVetBench is the first comprehensive, multi-task benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in the domain of veterinary medicine under the "One Health" framework1.Unlike previous benchmarks that rely solely on multiple-choice questions, VetBench systematically covers the three core pillars of Basic, Preventive, and Clinical Veterinary Medicine. It comprises 3,036 high-quality questions across 10 sub-disciplines and 11 task types, generated via a "Hybrid Construction Pipeline" involving rigorous expert validation222.<div align="center"><img src="assets/taxonomy.png" width="80%" alt="VetBench Taxonomy"><em>Figure 1: The Taxonomy of VetBench covering 10 expert-curated subcategories3.</em></div>⚡ News[2026-01]: 🚀 VetBench paper is released on arXiv.[2026-01]: 📂 The full dataset, expert-verified source texts, and evaluation prompts are open-sourced.🏆 LeaderboardWe evaluated mainstream proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific models.

Below is the detailed structure and description of each component.1. problem_bank/ (The Core Dataset)This folder contains the 3,036 evaluation questions6, categorized by the three pillars of veterinary medicine:basic_vet/: Covers Anatomy, Histology, Physiology, Biochemistry, Pathology, and Pharmacology7.preventive/: Covers Microbiology, Immunology, Parasitology, and Public Health (One Health)8.clinical/: Covers Internal Medicine, Surgery, and Obstetrics & Andrology9.File Format: Each file is a JSON/JSONL containing the question, options (if applicable), ground truth, and reference info.2. text/ (Source Material)This folder contains the 276 Core Passages used to generate the benchmark10.core_passages.json: These texts were extracted from 80k+ papers and books using our "Cascading Data Cleaning Pipeline" (Layout-Aware Parsing -> RefinedWeb Filtering -> Semantic Deduplication -> E5 Clustering)11.Significance: These passages serve as the "Reference Document" for Reading Comprehension tasks (RC1-RC5).3. prompt/ (Evaluation Prompts)We provide the exact prompts used for inference and evaluation to ensure reproducibility12.inference/: Prompts used to query the models (e.g., "Think like a clinical veterinarian..."). Includes instructions for both Direct Answer and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)13.judge/: The standardized prompts for the LLM-as-a-Judge (GPT-5.2), used to score open-ended generation tasks (QA-4, SUM-1, etc.). Based on our meta-evaluation, GPT-5.2 achieved the lowest MSE (4.01) against human experts14.4. few_shot/ (In-Context Learning)This folder contains the demonstration examples used for few-shot experiments15.shots.json: Organized by k shots (k={0, 1, 3, 5, 8}).Purpose: These examples are expert-written questions designed to guide the model's output format and reasoning logic16. Our experiments show that performance generally saturates after 5-shot17.📊 Task TaxonomyVetBench is not just Multiple Choice questions. It includes 11 distinct task types18:Task IDTask NameMetricQA-1/RC-1Single ChoiceAccuracyQA-2/RC-2Multiple ChoiceMacro-F1QA-3/RC-3Fill-in-the-BlankReference-based JudgeQA-4/RC-4Open-ended GenerationRubric-based JudgeSUM-1/2Summarization/ExtractionBERTScoreRC-5Subcategory ClassificationAccuracy📉 Key AnalysisCost-Benefit AnalysisWe conducted a comprehensive analysis of the trade-off between diagnostic accuracy and inference cost.

cd VetBench
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run EvaluationWe recommend using EvalScope 21 for standardized testing.Python# Example pseudo-code for loading data and prompts
import json

# 1. Load a clinical reasoning question
with open('./problem_bank/clinical/internal_medicine.json') as f:
    dataset = json.load(f)

# 2. Load the standardized prompt
with open('./prompt/inference/cot_prompt.json') as f:
    prompt_template = json.load(f)

# 3. Run inference (Insert your model generation code here)
