        "source_text": "Aiming at clarifying the effects of DTMUV on immune function, RT-qPCR results in Cherry Valley ducks indicated that innate immunity were suppressed to varying degrees after DTMUV infection. Meanwhile, an important host immune cell, mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was identified as the pivotal target cell of DTMUV infection. As the largest lymphoid organ, the existence of T, B lymphocyte, and blood-spleen barrier (BSB), could directly mediate cellular and humoral immune response, thereby collectively regulate the defense in antiviral infection. Hematoxylin-eosin staining results in spleen revealed that, after DTMUV infection, periellipsoidal lymphatic sheaths in spleen white pulp were showing vacuolar lesions, and TEM analysis concomitantly depicted mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum swelling at the ultrastructural level. Additionally, Yang S et al. carried out exploratory experiments on precedence relationship between the invasion of DTMUV into brain and destruction of blood-brain barrier (BBB), striving for the pathogenic mechanism underlying severe neurologic syndromes in ducks. Despite great advances in elaborating immune response and pathogenesis related to DTMUV infection, few studies were focused on the interaction between reproductive system (let alone the male reproductive system) and DTMUV which was firstly characterized by decreased egg production.",

        "source_text": "Feline panleukopenia, caused by the single-stranded DNA virus feline parvovirus (FPV), is a highly contagious and often lethal disease of cats and other Felidae. FPV, but also canine parvovirus (CPV) can be isolated from both healthy and diseased cats. In Germany, CPV was detected in only approximately 10% of feline samples, but in Southeast Asia, reports estimated that up to approximately 80% of diseased cats were infected with CPV. Infection spreads rapidly, especially in cells with high mitotic activity, such as bone marrow, lymphoid tissue and intestinal crypt cells. Anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea, neutropenia and lymphopenia are common in clinically affected cases. In utero or neonatal infection can result in cerebellar hypoplasia. Depending on the severity of clinical signs, mortality ranges from 25 to 100%. Effective vaccination and thorough disinfection are of the utmost importance in the prevention of disease transmission in multi-cat households and animal shelters. If clinical signs develop, supportive treatment should be commenced. The efficacy of feline recombinant interferon and FPV antibodies has not been clearly demonstrated. Commercially available vaccines should induce protective immunity when administered according to current guidelines. Recent studies suggest that in some kittens, maternally derived antibodies (MDA) can persist for much longer than has been previously recognised. FPV serum antibody tests are available, but protection status needs to be interpreted with caution in kittens with MDA and a negative titre in adult cats does not necessarily denote lack of protection.",

        "source_text": "The rabies virus belongs to the Lyssavirus genus. It is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of approximately 12 kb. It contains five genes, namely the nucleoprotein (N), the phosphoprotein (P), the matrix protein (M), the glycoprotein (G) and the large protein or polymerase (L), and a non-coding region. Among these, the nucleoprotein (N) is the most conserved gene, and the phosphoprotein (P) and glycoprotein (G) are the most variable ones. To date, 17 different viral species have been identified. Rabies is a viral infectious zoonotic disease endemic in many regions of the world, particularly Asia, Africa, and South America. In Tunisia, rabies is enzootic and endemic. Rabies virus (RABV) can be associated with a variety of mammalian hosts that maintain independent epidemiological cycles within geographical locations, resulting in the differentiation of the virus into several lineages. RABV strains that circulate in dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are responsible for more than 99% of all human cases worldwide. However, different wild mammals have been identified as RABV reservoirs, such as bat-eared foxes, black-backed jackals, and yellow mongooses in Southern Africa and red foxes in Europe and the Middle East. In different parts of the world, these species maintain sylvatic transmission cycles that can be independent from the primary urban cycle in which the dog is the main reservoir.",

Thus, mucus is a protective barrier. Mucus is a highly viscous material composed of high–molecular weight glycoproteins. Certain bacteria are able to degrade mucins using their carbohydrate components as carbon sources. Included in this group of bacteria are Ruminococcus, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Clostridium. Derrien et al. described a new member of the phylum Verrucomicrobia that was named Akkermansia muciniphila. A. muciniphila is a gram-negative, nonmotile, non-spore-forming strict anaerobe capable of growing on mucin. Ganesh et al. recently showed that A. muciniphila exacerbates inflammation in mice infected with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. In so doing, A. muciniphila likely provides S. enterica serovar Typhimurium with greater access to the intestinal epithelium, which might enhance its ability to cause disease. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that A. muciniphila is found in increased levels in pigs challenged orally with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium.",

Studies have shown that NS2 and M1 protein form complexes that can be detected in purified virions and cell lysates of virus-infected cells [2,3]. Hence, NS2 and (probably) NS1 of IAV are not considered as non-structural proteins, as these proteins can be detected in virions [4]. IBV possesses six structural proteins, HA, NA, NB, M2, M1, NP and NS2; 3 subunits of RNA polymerase complex, PA, PB1, and PB2; and nonstructural protein NS1 [5]. ICV and IDV have 4 structural proteins, M2, M1, NP, and the hemagglutinin–esterase fusion (HEF) protein that replaces the HA and NA of IAV or IBV; 3 subunits of RNA polymerase complex, P3, PB1, and PB2; and 2 nonstructural proteins, NS1 and NS2. IAV has several subtypes based on the HA and NA proteins. Currently, there are 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes, of which H1 to H16 and N1 to N9 have been isolated from birds; the subtypes H17, H18, N10, and N11 have been identified in bats [6,7].

Despite the chronic endemicity of the disease in Lebanon and neighbouring countries, recent data are scant. The objectives of this survey were to evaluate the current epidemiology of CE in Lebanon, investigate the prevalence and determine the infecting genotypes in locally raised sheep and goats. A multidimensional approach combining post-mortem inspection of slaughtered animals and molecular diagnosis of the parasite was conducted to this end. From 2018 to 2020, 62.9% of the sheep and 20.9% of the goats were found positive for CE. The presence of hydatids varied between organs, showing higher prevalence in the liver of sheep vs the lungs of goats, however, a higher fertility rate of hydatid cyst was observed in lungs for both animals. Molecular diagnosis based on partial mitochondrial cox1 gene (795 bp) showed that the majority of isolates were identified as E. granulosus sensu stricto (98.7%) and only one isolate from goat was identified as Echinococcus canadensis (genotype G7; 1.3%). Echinococcus granulosus s.s. population among the sheep and goats was represented by 22 haplotypes having very little genetic differentiation and relatively moderate haplotype diversity. Population demographics explored through neutrality indices suggested expanding population within the intermediate hosts. These results document the high prevalence of CE in the livestock of Lebanon and reveal for the first time the presence of three different genotypes G1, G3 and G7.",

However, the mechanisms driving milk immune influence are still poorly understood and may be mediated by cells and bioactive molecules present in milk, including microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs (17–25 nucleotides long), highly conserved across species2, that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of at least up to 60% of human genes, thus influencing many cellular processes, such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and cell death3–5. Milk miRNAs are, to some extent, packaged within extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are present in large amounts in milk6,7, and are, in such a way, protected from degradation in the gastrointestinal tract6,8. Therefore, they can survive digestion, be taken up by intestinal epithelial and immunologic cells in which they may be functionally active9,10. Thus, the survival of EV miRNAs and their influence on many biological processes make them crucial actors in the young and adult milk consumer health8,10–12. Whereas the repertories of miRNAs (miRNome) of human and cow’s milk EV were yet rather well described13–16, little is known in contrast on the miRNome of goat milk-derived EVs17. The objectives of this study were to determine the miRNome of milk-derived EVs from goat, and compare it with that of cow.",

How to decrease intestinal inflammation and improve chicken growth performance has become a special concern in chicken production worldwide. There are many immune cells in the intestine such as helper T (Th) cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells, which work together to keep the balance of immune response. Otherwise, breaking this balance will result in intestinal inflammation. Intestinal immune cells produced more pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e., interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β, and less anti-inflammatory cytokines, i.e., IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in the chicken intestine during chronic intestinal inflammation. Other studies indicated that pro-inflammatory cytokines were mainly produced by Th cells, especially Th17 cells, while anti-inflammatory cytokines were mainly produced by Treg cells. Furthermore, it has been established that chronic intestinal inflammation is closely associated with the imbalanced Th17 and Treg cells through critical transcriptional factors such as retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma t (rorγt) and forkhead box P3 (foxp3) and key cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-10, and TGF-β.",
