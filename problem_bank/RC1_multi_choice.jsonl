The genus Porphyromonas is one of the major periodontopathic bacteria in humans and companion animals (Norris and Love, 1999). There is a direct relationship between the development of gingivitis and the accumulation of dental plaque with an increase in numbers of the genus Porphyromonas."}

{"id": "24", "question": "Contextual materials: One of the possible limits to the information provided by published DTs in horses is the fact that they are determined from classic pharmacokinetic studies performed at rest under laboratory conditions.

Prolonged submaximal exercise has not been shown to influence plasma clearance of frusemide measured several minutes after the end of the test exercise (Dyke et al. 1996).

For example, swine HEV is a recognized zoonotic virus and has been definitively linked to sporadic and cluster cases of acute hepatitis in humans who have consumed raw or undercooked pork products (reviewed in Meng, 2010a,b, 2011a,b). Other emerging swine viruses such as PLHV and PERV are also of concern in human xenotransplantation with pig organs, tissues and cells (Abrahante et al., 2011)."}

{"id": "88", "question": "Contextual materials: Macrolide antibiotics and similar molecules are active against gram-­positive (S. aureus, Streptococcus spp.) and atypical pathogens (Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma spp.), but have a limited spectrum against gram-­negative organisms. Macrolides are ineffective against enteric gram-­ negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli and are ineffective against P. aeruginosa. They are active against fastidious gram-­negative organisms (Campylobacter spp., Borrelia spp., Bordetella spp., Brucella spp., Pasteurella spp., Haemophilus spp., H. pylori) and spirochetes (Treponema pallidum). Some differences exist in the overlapping spectrums of each macrolide antibiotic. Macrolides and their relatives are bacteriostatic agents that block bacterial protein synthesis. Macrolides may also inhibit production of bacterial virulence factors (Kanoh and Rubin 2010), may have anti-­inflammatory properties (Rubin and Tamaoki 2000; Culić et al. 2001), immunomodulatory activity (Piacentini et al. 2007), and effects on cell signaling (Clapham 2007). Resistance to macrolides and related compounds occurs in three ways (Nakajima 1999; Leclercq and Courvalin 2002). The first is target site modification by methylation or other mutation that prevents binding of the drug to the ribosomal target.

They are active against fastidious gram-­negative organisms (Campylobacter spp., Borrelia spp., Bordetella spp., Brucella spp., Pasteurella spp., Haemophilus spp., H. pylori) and spirochetes (Treponema pallidum). Some differences exist in the overlapping spectrums of each macrolide antibiotic. Macrolides and their relatives are bacteriostatic agents that block bacterial protein synthesis. Macrolides may also inhibit production of bacterial virulence factors (Kanoh and Rubin 2010), may have anti-­inflammatory properties (Rubin and Tamaoki 2000; Culić et al. 2001), immunomodulatory activity (Piacentini et al. 2007), and effects on cell signaling (Clapham 2007). Resistance to macrolides and related compounds occurs in three ways (Nakajima 1999; Leclercq and Courvalin 2002). The first is target site modification by methylation or other mutation that prevents binding of the drug to the ribosomal target. For example, the A2059G mutation confers high-­level resistance to macrolides such as erythromycin and azithromycin, moderate resistance to clarithromycin and clindamycin, but no resistance to streptogramins (Tait-­Kamradt et al. 2000; Canu et al. 2002). The second is efflux mediated by physiologic pumps that actively pump the drug out of the bacterial cell and are encoded by the mef (A) gene with efflux driven by proton motive force (Clancy et al. 1996). The third is drug inactivation by degradation from hydrolysis of the macrolide lactone ring or drug modification related to macrolide phosphorylation. Macrolide inactivation is rare and less common than other mechanisms of macrolide resistance."}

This is synonymous with the term buphthalmos, but as this term indicates that the globe is cow-­sized, which is actually smaller than a horse globe, hydrophthalmos is the preferred term in equids. Hydrophthalmos suggests an enlarged globe, whatever the original size. In adult horses, with glaucoma, globe size increases slowly and is associated with other clinical signs of glaucoma such as corneal edema and endothelial (Haab’s) striae (Figure 14).

The disease is a systemic viral disease characterized by necrosis of exocrine pancreatic tissue, cardiomyocytic necrosis, and white skeletal muscle degeneration [15]. SAV is an enveloped spherical virus measuring 60–70 nm in diameter belonging to the genus Alphavirus and family Togaviridae. The genome consists of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of approximately 12 kb. The genome codes for eight proteins, four of which are non-structural proteins (nsP1–nsP4), and the remaining four are capsid glycoproteins (E1, E2, E3 and 6K). Glycoprotein E2 induces neutralizing antibodies [21] and, hence, is an ideal candidate for developing sub-unit or DNA vaccines. Based on the sequences of protein E2 and nsP3, SAV isolates have been divided into six genotypes, SAV1–SAV6 [134]. Gills and intestinal track are the portals of entry. Although the predilection sites of the virus are not known, in acute cases, high titre of the virus is found in kidney, heart, blood, and several other organs. Virus is shed through mucus and faeces. Disease outbreaks are influenced by environmental factors, and increase in water temperature favours the virus [135]. The disease affects all life-stages in both freshwater and seawater [136].

The indiscriminate use of antibiotics as growth promoters for weight gain in poultry contributed to the spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in humans and has prompted the prohibition of antibiotics in the poultry sector, so bacteriophages or phages (viruses that infect and lyse bacteria) have emerged as a strategy bio-control of Salmonella. This can include applications intended to limit the spread of the bacterium or directly for the treatment of salmonellosis in poultry, an approach known as phage therapy [5-12]."}

In contrast, pheomelanosomes show no fibril formation presumably due to the lack of PMEL expression [3]. The fibrillary structures laterally assemble into sheets, which serve as a matrix for eumelanin deposition (reviewed by Watt and co-workers [4]). Mutations in the PMEL gene are associated with coat color dilution in the mouse [5], chicken [6], dog [7] and horse [8]. In cattle, PMEL function seems to be unique because effects of genetic variants are not restricted to eumelanic coat color dilution as reported for other vertebrates. The non-synonymous mutation  $PMELc.64G > A$  (NM_001080215.2) in the signal peptide region of the bovine PMEL protein (NP_001073684) is causative for the Dilution locus (https://omia.org/OMIA001545/9913/), associated with extreme coat color dilution in the Charolais cattle breed [9].

The relatively common FECV biotype replicates in feline intestinal enterocytes and is transmitted from cat to cat via the fecal-oral route [3,4]. According to the internal mutation hypothesis, the disease FIP is the result of genetic mutations in FECV, leading to a switch in viral host cell tropism from enterocytes to peritoneal-type macrophages, facilitating systemic spread and immunoinflammatory syndrome [5,6]. FIP is a complex, multi-systemic immuno-inflammatory disease characterized by fever, pyogranulomatous perivasculitis, effusion accumulation, fibrinous exudate and high mortality [3-5].

{"id": "272", "question": "Contextual materials: The interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immune response serves as the first line of host defense against invading viruses (Akira et al., 2006; Mogensen, 2009). Following pathogen detection and subsequent IFN production, IFN molecules bind to their cell-surface receptors and rapidly initiate a signaling cascade via the Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, leading to the induction of expression of a wide variety of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Kisseleva et al., 2002; Schneider et al., 2014). Upon IFN binding, IFN receptors undergo conformational changes and subsequently form dimeric or oligomeric complexes, which lead to JAK apposition and transphosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues, releasing their intrinsic catalytic activity (Levy and Darnell, 2002; Piehler et al., 2012). The activated JAKs in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domains of IFN receptors, providing binding sites for the Src-homology-2 (SH2) domain of the STAT proteins (Bousoik and Montazeri Aliabadi, 2018). After binding to the receptors, STAT proteins are phosphorylated by JAKs. Phosphorylated STATs dissociate from the receptor-JAK complexes, form homo- or heterodimers, and then translocate to the nucleus where they complex with other nuclear proteins and bind to IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and gamma-activated sequence (GAS) to regulate hundreds of ISGs expression (Sands et al., 2006).

Following pathogen detection and subsequent IFN production, IFN molecules bind to their cell-surface receptors and rapidly initiate a signaling cascade via the Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, leading to the induction of expression of a wide variety of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Kisseleva et al., 2002; Schneider et al., 2014). Upon IFN binding, IFN receptors undergo conformational changes and subsequently form dimeric or oligomeric complexes, which lead to JAK apposition and transphosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues, releasing their intrinsic catalytic activity (Levy and Darnell, 2002; Piehler et al., 2012). The activated JAKs in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domains of IFN receptors, providing binding sites for the Src-homology-2 (SH2) domain of the STAT proteins (Bousoik and Montazeri Aliabadi, 2018).

{"id": "275", "question": "Contextual materials: The innate immune response is the first line of host defense against microbial pathogens. Various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play an essential role in detecting pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) associated with invading pathogens. PAMP recognition initiates an innate immune response, characterized by the production of type I interferon (IFN), proinflammatory cytokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (1, 2). PRRs comprise multiple family members, including toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and cytosolic dsDNA sensors (CDSs). RLRs primarily recognize  $5^{\\prime}$ -phosphorylated RNAs, including ssRNA or dsRNA produced during the replication of RNA or DNA viruses (3).
