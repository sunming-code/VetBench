The presence of surfactant is crucial in this process; by decreasing the surface tension of the distal airways, the surfactant decreases the elastic recoil of the lung, hence decreasing expiratory emptying of the lung.

Thus, we evaluated the effect of milk from goats fed a conventional diet, a conventional diet supplemented with  $30\\%$  Acacia farnesiana (AF) pods or grazing on metabolic alterations in mice fed a HF diet. Interestingly, the incorporation of goat's milk in the diet decreased body weight and body fat mass, improved glucose tolerance, prevented adipose tissue hypertrophy and hepatic steatosis in mice fed a HF diet. These effects were associated with an increase in energy expenditure, augmented oxidative fibers in skeletal muscle, and reduced inflammatory markers. Consequently, goat's milk can be considered a non-pharmacologic strategy to improve the metabolic alterations induced by a HF diet.

The newly formed sub-genotype 1.4 comprises Cuban isolates that were so far placed into sub-genotype 1.2 (de Arce et al., 2005; Pereda et al., 2005). Regrouping was done after phylogenetic analyses of full-length E2 sequences revealed that these isolates formed a separate sub-genotype and were quite divergent from other genotype 1 strains. An additional differentiation and sub-grouping was suggested for sub-genotypes 2.1 (Cha et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2013) and 2.3 (Blome et al., 2010). However, these systems were not internationally harmonized (e.g. clades/clusters 2.1a-2.1c, cluster 2.3.1 and 2.3.2). The latter sub-genotype was also subdivided within the EU based on clusters or lineages observed in the  $5^{\\prime}$ -NTR-based phylogenetic tree.

However, the risk of antibiotic resistance development and the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes to other animal pathogens, as well as concerns for environmental impact and consumer safety, have stimulated the need for new sustainable control measures (Brandt et al. 2015). Vaccination is a sustainable control measure, but various viral and bacterial fish diseases, and more specifically fungal and oomycete diseases, cannot yet be controlled by vaccination (Evensen and Leong 2013; Dhar, Manna and Thomas Allnutt 2014; Holvold et al. 2014).

{"id": "60", "question": "The evolution of pandemic viruses requires a 'perfect ecological storm' in which multiple host populations perform at least two key functions: (a) generating and sustaining viral diversity and (b) transmitting viral diversity to humans. Reservoir hosts serve the former role, harboring high viral genetic diversity but with low rates of direct contact with humans (such as wild birds, bats, or rodents) (5). Intermediary hosts are typically livestock or domestic animals that serve the latter role: they often harbor only a subset of the viral diversity that circulates in reservoir hosts yet are capable of transmitting viral diversity to humans via high rates of contact (1). In the United States, commercial swine serve as reservoir hosts, and exhibition swine effectively serve as intermediary hosts. Commercial swine are produced for food production exclusively in a year-round system that is highly conducive to the evolution and sustained transmission of genetically diverse viruses (6), but less conducive to zoonotic transmission, with high biosecurity and less frequent contact with humans. In contrast, exhibition swine effectively serve as intermediary hosts because they are raised and exhibited in a system with low biosecurity that maximizes human contact (7, 8) but purges genetic diversity and host immunity at the end of the summer show season when exhibition swine finish showing and a new cohort of swine are raised for next year (9).

The alkalinity of the pancreatic juice is maintained by the production of bicarbonate, which neutralises the acidic gastric juice.", "A": "Anatomy", "B": "Histology and Embryology", "C": "Physiology", "D": "Biochemistry", "E": "Pathology", "F": "Pharmacology", "G": "Microbiology", "H": "Parasitology", "I": "Public Health", "J": "Internal Medicine", "K": "Surgery", "L": "Obstetrics", "answer": "C"}
{"id": "69", "question": "The hypothalamus in chickens is responsible for controlling temperature regulation, feeding behavior, water balance, and reproduction. It plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis. It regulates body temperature through thermoregulatory mechanisms, ensuring that birds maintain a stable internal temperature. It is involved in the control of various behaviors, including feeding, drinking, aggression, sexual behavior, and parental care. Different hypothalamic nuclei, such as the lateral and the ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, are associated with specific behavioral patterns (Balthazart and Ball 2007). It controls feeding behavior in chickens by regulating hunger and satiety. The arcuate nucleus in the hypothalamus produces neuropeptides that stimulate or suppress appetite, depending on the nutritional status of the chicken (Sohn 2015). Environmental cues, such as light, temperature, and social interactions, can influence hypothalamic function in chickens. Photoperiod, for instance, affects reproductive activities and seasonal adaptations in response to changing day lengths (Bentley 2009). The hypothalamus regulates water balance in chickens by controlling thirst and fluid intake. The supraoptic nucleus produces vasopressin which regulates water reabsorption in the kidneys.", "A": "Anatomy", "B": "Histology and Embryology", "C": "Physiology", "D": "Biochemistry", "E": "Pathology", "F": "Pharmacology", "G": "Microbiology", "H": "Parasitology", "I": "Public Health", "J": "Internal Medicine", "K": "Surgery", "L": "Obstetrics", "answer": "C"}

They are completely separated from the pharyngeal endodermal cells. Mesenchymal cells migrate to the thymus from the surrounding head mesenchyme and arrive through the blood vessels penetrating the thymic tissue. Head mesenchymal cells form the stroma except for the epithelial-­ reticular component which is endodermal in origin. These cells produce the meshwork or the reticulum within the thymus. The thymus migrates superficially along the cervical region close to the external jugular vein and vagus nerve to reach the entrance of the thoracic portion of the celomic cavity. It is usually represented by six to eight lobes completely separated from each other (Singh 2019) (Figure 5).

{"id": "71", "question": "Feral swine are an invasive species introduced into the United States by Spanish explorers in the 1500s and have significantly expanded their range to at least 38 states (35, 36). Swine were introduced to Hawai'i much earlier when Polynesian voyagers settled on the islands (37). Feral swine are the same species as domesticated swine, Sus scrofa, and often include a variety of phenotypic and genotypic traits from both populations (35, 38). At about 1 year of age, female swine can breed and produce up to ten piglets each year (39). The rapid reproduction rate and lack of predation have aided the geographic and population expansion of feral swine (35). The expansion of feral swine across the United States is a concern for numerous reasons, including conservation of threatened/endangered species; damage to agriculture and livestock, leading to major economic loss; and transmission of pathogens to humans or livestock (40). For example, a proportion of feral swine in the state of Texas have been found to harbor antibodies against Bacillus anthracis, suggesting exposure to the causative agent of anthrax (41). Feral swine are also a reservoir for other human and animal diseases including, but not limited to, brucellosis, trichinellosis, tuberculosis, leptospirosis, and classical swine fever (42).

Outbreaks of BGD tend to occur when environmental conditions deteriorate, and opportunistic pathogens can more readily cause overt disease (Bullock 1972; Schachte 1983). The putative causative agent, Flavobacterium branchiophilum, has been shown to induce BGD under laboratory conditions (e.g. Lumsden et al. 1995; Ostland et al. 1995); however, diagnosis of BGD in the field is generally carried out through light microscopy and/or observation of clinical signs. Therefore, the identity of the bacterial specie(s) present on the gills of BGD-affected fish in culture settings is most often based on visual assessment alone. The observed bacteria using microscopy are presumed to be  $F$  branchiophilum based on organism morphology (numerous long, thin rods; Fig. 1.), with this presumption supported by previous BGD research (e.g. Byrne et al. 1995; Ostland et al. 1997; Derksen, Ostland & Ferguson 1998) and various  $F.$  branchiophilumspecific diagnostic approaches that have been developed.

It is clear that there is considerable variation between species not least because of anatomical and physiological differences. Endocrine factors certainly appear to have a significant role. The requirement for the descent of the mammalian testes to an extra-­abdominal location is due to the need to lower the temperature by 2–3°C of the body temperature for spermatogenesis (see Section 5). However, the testes of the elephant and the hyrax are intra-­abdominal. Inguinal passage occurs at about 120 days of pregnancy in the ox, 80 days in the sheep and 90 days in the pig. In the horse, however, the testis is drawn to the inguinal ring, but at 100–120 days the foetal gonad starts to enlarge rapidly and is unable to pass through the inguinal canal. The gonads reach maximum size at about 210–240 days of pregnancy. The testes then undergo shrinkage until inguinal passage is possible at about 300 days, although some distortion of the testes is still necessary.

{"id": "76", "question": "The cuticle is an extremely thin proteinaceous layer, which plugs the entry to the shell pores and regulates the permeability to gases, liquids, and particles (Board and Halls 1973; Mortola 2009). The cuticle is deposited by the epithelial cells lining the hen uterus during the last 5 h before oviposition (Nys et al. 1999). The cuticle thickness on the eggs of domestic hens varies from 0.5 to 12.8 μm and can have an uneven or patchy distribution on the eggshell surface (Board and Halls 1973). Theoretically, the cuticle subserves diverse functions, varying from reducing water loss to the first lines of defense against bacterial penetration by blocking the external surface of pores (Kulshreshtha et al. 2018). It has been shown that cuticle composition is correlated with the hen age and egg ­freshness, and this information could be useful to design strategies to evaluate and reduce the contamination risks during egg processing (Rodríguez-­Navarro et al. 2013). The cuticle consists of 85–87% protein, 3.5–4.4% carbohydrates, 2.5–3.5% lipids, and 3.5% ash (Nys et al. 1999; Rose-­Martel et al. 2012; Rodríguez-­Navarro et al. 2013). It is recommended to lightly brush off any organic debris from eggs, rather than washing them, to prevent damage to the cuticle. If eggs are to be cleaned then it is recommended to use water that is warmer, specifically 20 °F (11 °C) warmer, than the egg so that contaminants are not drawn into the egg via vacuum action through the pores in the shell (Damerov 1994).", "A": "Anatomy", "B": "Histology and Embryology", "C": "Physiology", "D": "Biochemistry", "E": "Pathology", "F": "Pharmacology", "G": "Microbiology", "H": "Parasitology", "I": "Public Health", "J": "Internal Medicine", "K": "Surgery", "L": "Obstetrics", "answer": "A"}

Topical therapy is available as a shampoo, spray, wipe, mousse, or gel and should contain 2% chlorhexidine with 2% miconazole or ketoconazole, 3–4% chlorhexidine when it is the sole active ingredient, 1–2% miconazole, or 2% climbazole. A frequency of two to three times per week for three to four weeks is recommended for active infection; this can be reduced to one to two times per week for maintenance and prevention. The author prefers shampoo for generalized infections and wipes for facial fold, claw fold, and interdigital treatment. Ketoconazole (5–10 mg/kg/day) and itraconazole (5–10 mg/kg/day) are the most effective oral therapeutic options for dogs. Overall itraconazole is better tolerated, although some canine patients will have gastrointestinal upset (vomiting, inappetence, and diarrhea) with both oral medications. Fluconazole (5–10 mg/kg/day) is another option and may have fewer adverse effects and drug interactions, but may not be as reliable for Malassezia treatment. Terbinafine (30 mg/kg/day) does not achieve high stratum corneum or sebum concentrations and is not as effective for surface infections (Gimmler et al. 2015). The duration of oral therapy varies, but most cases are given daily therapy for 20–30 days, then if pulse therapy is needed, the dose is continued one to three times a week. The compounded versions of any of the azole medications should be avoided due to poor bioavailability of these formulations.", "A": "Anatomy", "B": "Histology and Embryology", "C": "Physiology", "D": "Biochemistry", "E": "Pathology", "F": "Pharmacology", "G": "Microbiology", "H": "Parasitology", "I": "Public Health", "J": "Internal Medicine", "K": "Surgery", "L": "Obstetrics", "answer": "J"}
{"id": "91", "question": "Macrolide antibiotics and similar molecules are active against gram-­positive (S. aureus, Streptococcus spp.) and atypical pathogens (Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma spp.), but have a limited spectrum against gram-­negative organisms. Macrolides are ineffective against enteric gram-­ negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli and are ineffective against P. aeruginosa. They are active against fastidious gram-­negative organisms (Campylobacter spp., Borrelia spp., Bordetella spp., Brucella spp., Pasteurella spp., Haemophilus spp., H. pylori) and spirochetes (Treponema pallidum). Some differences exist in the overlapping spectrums of each macrolide antibiotic. Macrolides and their relatives are bacteriostatic agents that block bacterial protein synthesis. Macrolides may also inhibit production of bacterial virulence factors (Kanoh and Rubin 2010), may have anti-­inflammatory properties (Rubin and Tamaoki 2000; Culić et al. 2001), immunomodulatory activity (Piacentini et al. 2007), and effects on cell signaling (Clapham 2007). Resistance to macrolides and related compounds occurs in three ways (Nakajima 1999; Leclercq and Courvalin 2002). The first is target site modification by methylation or other mutation that prevents binding of the drug to the ribosomal target. For example, the A2059G mutation confers high-­level resistance to macrolides such as erythromycin and azithromycin, moderate resistance to clarithromycin and clindamycin, but no resistance to streptogramins (Tait-­Kamradt et al. 2000; Canu et al. 2002). The second is efflux mediated by physiologic pumps that actively pump the drug out of the bacterial cell and are encoded by the mef (A) gene with efflux driven by proton motive force (Clancy et al. 1996). The third is drug inactivation by degradation from hydrolysis of the macrolide lactone ring or drug modification related to macrolide phosphorylation.

{"id": "92", "question": "A Wood’s lamp examination is one of the simplest screening tools for dermatophytosis, but is only useful for some strains of \\(M.\\) canis, since only \\(M.\\) canis produces the classic emerald or apple-­green fluorescence of the hair shaft (Figure 9). In the hands of a skilled user, a Wood’s lamp will detect positive \\(M.\\) canis infection approximately 70–100% of the time (Moriello et al. 2017). Unfortunately, lint, skin surface crust and debris, and topical medications can cause similar fluorescence, which can lead to false positive results. Glowing hairs should be plucked and examined under the microscope for confirmation of the diagnosis. Hairs treated with appropriate topical therapy will not cease to fluoresce; but only the infected portion will glow, so a simple trick for monitoring response to treatment is to watch for loss of fluorescence as hairs grow out. Direct microscopic evaluation of infected hairs is another reliable diagnostic tool in the hands of a skilled examiner. Hairs from the edge of a lesion are plucked and placed on a slide with mineral oil and a coverslip. They are evaluated for the presence of hyphae and arthrospores on 100× power. Lowering and closing the condenser can increase contrast, which allows spores and hyphae to stand out. Infected hairs tend to be larger in diameter with a fuzzy or irregular outline, and they lack a clear demarcation between the cortex and the medulla. Most dermatophyte infections in animals produce an ectothrix distribution of arthrospores: coccoid elements surrounding the outside of the hair shaft. Hyphae will be seen growing within the hair shaft (Figure 6.10).

Reduction of fracture without incising the skin or exposing the bone, through external manipulation, is called closed reduction. The technique involves holding the major bone segments over the skin, separating the impacted broken ends by traction if needed and then aligning them to the near normal anatomical position. Normally, after a closed reduction, fracture is immobilized with an external fixation technique, although in certain internal fixation, reduction can be achieved externally as in fresh cases of incomplete/greenstick fractures of femur in young animals without bone displacement. Closed reduction is generally indicated in fresh lower limb fractures, comprising only two bone pieces with little or no overriding of the bone segments.

In some cases, there may be absence of contractions from the dam, particularly in protracted cases of dystocia, with dead and emphysematous fetuses. Forceful traction should always be avoided in the case of a living fetus, for the grip of the forceps generally causes it severe injury. Hobday’s forceps are generally employed. It should always be remembered that a Caesarean operation or, in the case of putrid fetuses, hysterectomy, will carry a better prognosis for the bitch or queen than prolonged attempts at forceps delivery. In cases requiring traction, even when the fetus is dead, the presentation, position, and posture should be evaluated to enable correction before application of traction; this may necessitate initial repulsion (Fig. 18.7). The aim is to obtain a secure grip across the fetal cranium or pelvis, so that considerable traction can be applied.

{"id": "99", "question": "Idiopathic Megaesophagus Idiopathic megaesophagus is the most common cause of regurgitation in the dog.10 Aside from dysautonomia, megaesophagus is a rare finding in the domestic cat. The disorder is characterized by esophageal hypomotility and dilation, progressive regurgitation, and loss of body condition. Several forms of the syndrome have been described, including congenital, acquired secondary, and acquired idiopathic megaesophagus. Dysautonomia Dysautonomia is a generalized autonomic neuropathy that was originally reported in cats in the United Kingdom, but that has now been documented in dogs and cats throughout Western Europe and the United States.11,12 Clinical signs reflect a generalized autonomic dysfunction but megaesophagus, esophageal hypomotility, and regurgitation are fairly consistent findings. Pathologically, degenerative lesions are found in autonomic ganglia, intermediate gray columns of the spinal cord, and some sympathetic axons. No definitive etiology has ever been established despite an intensive search for genetic, toxic, nutritional, and infectious etiologic agents. Gastroesophageal Intussusception Gastroesophageal intussusception is a rare condition of young dogs (most younger than 3 months of age) resulting from invagination of stomach into the esophagus, with or without other abdominal organs (e.g., spleen, duodenum, pancreas, omentum).17 Many affected animals have preexisting esophageal disease, most importantly idiopathic megaesophagus. The role of idiopathic megaesophagus in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal intussusception is not well understood, but it may be that the greatly enlarged capacity of a dilated esophagus accommodates invagination of the stomach through the diaphragmatic hiatus.

Pneumothorax can be closed or open depending on whether or not there is communication between the pleural space and outside the thorax. The most common causes of pneumothorax in dogs are likely blunt force trauma from car collisions or penetrating trauma from an inhaled foreign body. Exposure to porcupine quills has also resulted in pneumothorax in the northern United States and Canada (Sevy et al. 2023). In the cat, blunt trauma occurs from a car accident or fall from a height, although inflammatory lower airway disease is also a common cause of pneumothorax (Mooney et al. 2012). In dogs or cats, esophageal perforation can lead to pneumothorax, and it can also result from rupture of an emphysematous bulla, pleural bleb, neoplasm, Paragonimus cyst, or abscessed lung lobe. Lung necrosis due to embolization associated with heartworm disease or pulmonary thromboembolic disease has also been implicated in pneumothorax. Barotrauma during anesthesia or mechanical ventilation is recognized as an iatrogenic cause of pneumothorax and it can also occur post-­thoracocentesis or fine-­needle lung aspiration.

Infection on farms is more commonly acquired by mouth from hands contaminated by infected animals, their bedding and surroundings. In addition to the general safety measures outlined in the Introduction, the following simple precautions will go a long way towards preventing people associated with livestock from becoming infected with salmonellosis: Ensure that anyone with diarrhoea, vomiting or flu-like illness consults a doctor, and informs the doctor if salmonellae have been isolated from livestock. Don’t allow vulnerable people, including children, the elderly, those with a weakened immune system and pregnant women to come into contact with infected animals.

Radiographic findings in feline heartworm disease are reflected by enlargement of caudal pulmonary lobar arteries to greater than 6 times the size of the ninth rib (Figure 8.5). However, in some cases pulmonary infiltrates can obscure visualization of the vasculature, and in one study of naturally infected cats, abnormalities in the pulmonary vasculature were uncommon (Venco et al. 2008). Unlike dogs, cardiac chambers are unlikely to be changed by heartworm infection. Focal or diffuse bronchointerstitial infiltrates are the most common parenchymal changes in cats with heartworm, but the presence and type of infiltrates depend on the stage of disease (Venco et al. 2008). Heartworm antibody positivity indicates only exposure to heartworm, and false-­ negative tests are unfortunately common. The antigen test can detect a single female heartworm, but can be falsely negative when no females are present or when only a few live males are present. Also, antigen–antibody complex formation appears to be more problematic in cats than in dogs, and heat-­treating serum leads to a substantial increase in positive antigen tests in infected cats (Little et al. 2014).

These characteristics explain why non-virulent strains are not able to cause disease in healthy animals and are controlled by the innate immune system. On the opposite side, virulent strains can evade the immune system and cause disease. After the initial colonization of the upper respiratory tract, virulent strains can reach the lung, where they survive due to their ability to resist phagocytosis. After nasal inoculation, virulent strains can be found colonizing not only the nasal mucosa, but also the tracheal mucosa, where they can form biofilm-like structures. When virulent strains reach the lung, they are confronted by PAM. The interaction between virulent \\(H.\\) parasuis and PAM is limited and macrophage activation is delayed. During lung infection, \\(H.\\) parasuis adapt its metabolism to survive in the lung environment and express the necessary virulence factors to resist host defences (Fig. 4). Bacterial capsule and two surface proteins from the trimeric autotransporter family, named VtaA8 and VtaA9 (virulence-associated trimeric autotransporters o VtaA), play a role in phagocytosis resistance. Survival of virulent \\(H.\\) parasuis in the lung induces inflammation, including neutrophil recruitment, which may result in suppurative bronchopneumonia. The study of cellular location of virulent \\(H.\\) parasuis in the lung has shown that it can be found associated with neutrophils and macrophages, but also with pneumocytes. This later location of \\(H.\\) parasuis within pneumocytes may serve as a reservoir for persistent infections.", "A": "Anatomy", "B": "Histology and Embryology", "C": "Physiology", "D": "Biochemistry", "E": "Pathology", "F": "Pharmacology", "G": "Microbiology", "H": "Parasitology", "I": "Public Health", "J": "Internal Medicine", "K": "Surgery", "L": "Obstetrics", "answer": "G"}

Venipuncture in salamanders is generally performed using the caudal tail vein. This is the same technique described previously for both lizards and snakes. It is important to remember that the vessel is very small and can collapse easily; therefore, do not place a large amount of negative pressure on the syringe during collection. A 25- to 27-gauge needle attached to a 1-mL syringe should be used. An insulin syringe can also be used for very small patients. The blood sample should be placed in a heparinized Microtainer tube for analysis. Venipuncture sites in frogs and toads include the femoral vein, ventral abdominal vein, and the lingual vein. The femoral and lingual veins are rarely used. The ventral abdominal vein is by far the easiest vessel to obtain a blood sample from. The frog or toad is gently positioned on its back with the restrainer holding the pectoral girdle.

SAV is an enveloped spherical virus measuring 60–70 nm in diameter belonging to the genus Alphavirus and family Togaviridae. The genome consists of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of approximately 12 kb. The genome codes for eight proteins, four of which are non-structural proteins (nsP1–nsP4), and the remaining four are capsid glycoproteins (E1, E2, E3 and 6K). Glycoprotein E2 induces neutralizing antibodies [21] and, hence, is an ideal candidate for developing sub-unit or DNA vaccines. Based on the sequences of protein E2 and nsP3, SAV isolates have been divided into six genotypes, SAV1–SAV6 [134]. Gills and intestinal track are the portals of entry. Although the predilection sites of the virus are not known, in acute cases, high titre of the virus is found in kidney, heart, blood, and several other organs. Virus is shed through mucus and faeces. Disease outbreaks are influenced by environmental factors, and increase in water temperature favours the virus [135]. The disease affects all life-stages in both freshwater and seawater [136].

The functions of FOXO3 in the control of the cell cycle may explain its association with longevity. FOXO3 induces cellular apoptosis by activating apoptosis-related factors, such as Fas ligand  $(FasL)$ , BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), autophagy-related 8 (ATG8), TNF superfamily member 10 (TRAIL), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (Nakamura et al., 2000; Ghaffari et al., 2003; Shao et al., 2016). FOXO3 is an activator of the protein degradation pathway and it can promote the expression of muscle atrophy factors, including F-box protein 32 (FBXO32) (also known as atrogin 1) and muscle specific ring finger protein (MURF) to induce the atrophy of muscles (Lee et al., 2004; Sandri et al., 2004).

{"id": "124", "question": "Myoglobin and free hemoglobin impart a reddish color to the urine that does not clear with settling or centrifugation (Figure 8a,b). Both pigments can turn darker over time, while the sample awaits analysis, but myoglobin more consistently turns reddish-­brown to brown in color [2]. In this situation, the reagent pad will be positive for occult blood (see Chapter 5), but intact erythrocytes are not seen in the urinary sediment. In patients with hemoglobinuria, the serum will be pink owing to hemoglobin binding to haptoglobin. Myoglobin has no carrier protein, and its presence does not result in discoloration of serum because it is rapidly cleared from the circulation. A simple screening test using ammonium sulfate can discriminate between myoglobin and hemoglobin in urine. Myoglobin in urine largely stays in solution when exposed to 80% saturation of urine with ammonium sulfate, whereas hemoglobin is completely precipitated [16]. Although evaluation of serum color and use of ammonium sulfate precipitation testing can presumptively distinguish between hemoglobinuria and myoglobinuria, definitive differentiation requires urinary protein electrophoresis. Myoglobinuria probably occurs more commonly than diagnosed because it is easily confused with hemoglobinuria. Myoglobinuria sometimes is observed with exertional rhabdomyolysis in horses and dogs, and during postanesthetic rhabdomyolysis in horses [17–19]. Porphyrins in urine turn red after oxidation of porphobilinogen. This color intensifies upon standing and often is described as red or port wine [3]. The color of the urine supernatant does not change after centrifugation. In cats, porphyrinuria has been described as imparting an orange–brown color to urine that becomes orange–pink during fluorescence. Teeth of affected cats are also discolored with an orange–brown shade and undergo red fluorescence [20–23]. Intermittent porphyria and congenital erythropoietic porphyria have been described in cats [23]. Rabbits often can have red urine as a result of ingesting porphyrins in cabbage, carrots, dandelions, parsley or broccoli, and this red color can be a normal finding [24].

{"id": "125", "question": "The most common abnormal urine color is pink, red, or reddish brown and can be attributed to intact red blood cells (RBC), hemolyzed RBC, muscle pigments, food pigments, or porphyrins (Figure 3). The most common cause of pink to red urine is the presence of intact RBC (hematuria) (Figure 4.4a–e). Intact RBC in urine impart a pink to brown color to urine, depending on the number of RBC, urine pH, and length of time the RBC have been in the urine [2]. A substantial number of RBC must be present in urine before a pink or red color is observed (Figure 4.5). Light pink color was observed in urine from dogs when approximately 600 RBC/hpf were present in the urine sediment and dark pink color was observed when 800–950 RBC/hpf were present [14]. Red color from intact RBC in urine clears with centrifugation or settling (Figure 4.6). Hemoglobinuria from intravascular hemolysis or lysis of previously intact red cells in the urine specimen (in vivo or in vitro) also may cause reddish color that persists in the supernatant after settling or centrifugation (Figure 4.7a,b). Uncommonly, the presence of myoglobinuria, or rarely porphyrinuria, may cause a reddish color (see also Chapter 5, occult blood). Rarely, dyes used in the manufacture of some dry dog foods or ingestion of an unusual food item will impart a pink color to the urine. Discoloration caused by free hemoglobin, myoglobin, porphyrin, or dyes will persist in the urine supernatant after centrifugation, because they are dissolved in the urine. The term “beeturia” has been used to describe pink to deep red discolored urine from human patients after eating beets or foods that have been colored with beet pigments. Betacyanuria is the preferred scientific term that describes these red pigments in urine. Betanin and its epimer isobetanin contribute most of this red color. Urine can become progressively pinker when beetroot pigments are exposed to sunlight. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can be used to definitively identify beetroot pigments in urine, but this is not clinically necessary since beeturia is a benign condition.

Based on genetic differences, NDV are currently classified in two major groups (class I and class II) (Czegledi et al., 2006), and the class II viruses have higher genetic and virulence variability and are known to infect a wide range of domestic and wild birds. They are divided into at least 18 genotypes (named I to XVIII), and vNDV belonging to multiple class II genotypes are identified in poultry outbreaks worldwide (Dimitrov et al., 2016). vNDV from different genotypes are often identified in wild birds, and the latter have been speculated to play a role in the spread of the virus (Snoeck et al., 2013). However, it is suggested that most of the wild bird isolations are a result of spillover of virus from infected poultry (Miller and Koch, 2013). Notably, there are two known exceptions where virulent viruses are endemic in wild birds. Birds of the family Columbidae are known to be a reservoir of the antigenic variants of vNDV, commonly referred to as pigeon paramyxoviruses 1 (PPMV-1). These pigeon-origin viruses are distributed worldwide, are commonly isolated from both wild and domestic pigeons, and are highly virulent for these species (Ujvari et al., 2003).

Myxomatous mitral valve degeneration is prevalent in the canine, and most adult dogs develop some degree of mitral valve disease as they age, highlighting the apparent vulnerability of canine heart valves to injury. Myxomatous valvular remodeling is associated with characteristic histopathologic features. Changes include expansion of extracellular matrix with glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans; valvular interstitial cell alteration; and attenuation or loss of the collagen-laden fibrosa layer. These lead to malformation of the mitral apparatus, biomechanical dysfunction, and mitral incompetence. Mitral regurgitation is the most common manifestation of myxomatous valve disease and in advanced stages, associated volume overload promotes progressive valvular regurgitation, left atrial and left ventricular remodeling, atrial tears, chordal rupture, and congestive heart failure.

It can be caused by secondary infections with Gram-negative bacteria. The initial cause of the damage can be rubbing of the snout on vivarium glass, particularly in snakes. The use of opaque tape stuck to the outside of the glass helps the snake to ‘see it’, preventing this injury. Stomatitis may also be due to the overzealous force-feeding of anorectic reptiles or to other disease or stresses leading to reduced immune system function. Uric acid crystals deposited around the base of the teeth, due to visceral gout and renal failure, can allow infections to occur. Herpesvirus and ranavirus infections in terrestrial tortoises are also a cause, with oral ulceration and diphtherisis (see Figure 9). Mycoplasma spp. infections may also be associated with stomatitis in tortoises. Devriesea agamarum, a bacterium, has been reported in agamid lizards as a cause of proliferative cheilitis, pericloacal disease and dermatitis. Adenoviruses have been implicated in snakes and lizards and IBD in snakes. Diagnosis is made on impression smears and bacterial swab and culture of samples.

Historically, glucocorticoids have been the most commonly prescribed medication for treatment of CAD, but even these are often used in conjunction with other therapies, such as bathing, antihistamines and fatty acids. Antihistamines have been described as having little benefit in managing atopic dermatitis;[3-5] however, antihistamines remain one of the most frequently used medications to treat the pruritus associated with CAD in dogs.

However, clinically, the most conventional method of taking a canine's temperature is through the rectal mucosa, as it continues to be a minimally invasive method that provides insight to core temperature (Kreissl and Neiger, 2015). Rectal thermometers have drawbacks, as they cannot be easily used on aggressive canids or ones with an infection or rupture of the anal mucosa (Kreissl and Neiger, 2015). To bypass the limitations caused by rectal temperatures, studies have been done using non - contact infrared (IR) thermometers, and focusing on alternative areas such as the axilla, auricular canal, and ocular regions of the canine (Gomart et al., 2014, Zanghi, 2016).", "A": "Anatomy", "B": "Histology and Embryology", "C": "Physiology", "D": "Biochemistry", "E": "Pathology", "F": "Pharmacology", "G": "Microbiology", "H": "Parasitology", "I": "Public Health", "J": "Internal Medicine", "K": "Surgery", "L": "Obstetrics", "answer": "C"}

Large colonies of Wolbachia reside in the subdermal lateral cords of both male and female nematodes, as well as in the reproductive structures of females (Slatko et al. 2010). Within the past decade, scientists demonstrated the obligate nature of this symbiosis by treating pathogenic nematodes with antibiotics, which quickly curtailed embryogenesis, progression of larval stages, and growth of adult worms (Slatko et al. 2010). It is now widely accepted by those within the field of heartworm research that the presence of W. pipientis within the bodies of adult worms is vital to survival and reproduction. Evidence towards the intense coevolution of this symbiosis can be found in the phylogenetic connections among many worms that contain Wolbachia, as well as the existence of Wolbachia within the common bedbug, among other insect species (Bandi et al. 2001; Slatko et al. 2010). The fact that Wolbachia surface protein (WSP) illicits a damaging humoral response from canine tissue in D. immitis infections suggests that D. immitis selection for storage of Wolbachia combats the typical parasite attenuation strategy within the host.

This discrepancy can be broadly categorized according to dietary preference: mammals belonging to the carnivore/omnivore taxa are susceptible to breast cancer, whereas herbivores are much less exposed (reviewed in [18, 19]). For example, mammary tumors are the most common neoplasm in female dogs, with up to  $50\\%$  being malignant [20]. In cats, mammary tumors account for about  $17\\%$  of all neoplasms, with  $80 - 90\\%$  being malignant [21]. Wild carnivores, such as jungle cats, jaguars, leopards, lions, and tigers also develop mammary tumors, which exhibit morphological patterns similar to those in human breast cancer [19]. In contrast, mammary tumors have rarely been reported in domestic mares [22, 23], cows (Table 1), ewes [24], goats, or sows [25]. Mammary cancer is also rare in zoo and freeranging ungulates [26-28]. These significant differences in mammary gland tumor development may have contributed to the generally lower mortality rates observed in clovenhooved domestic or zoo mammals—compared to carnivores [29]. Pigs are cloven-hoofed animals and omnivores, capable of consuming both plant and animal matter. Notably, there are significant morphological similarities between their mammary glands and the human breast.

However, porcine epithelial cells have been shown to develop neoplasia following oncogenic transformation and subsequent injection into mouse mammary glands [31].

{"id": "203", "question": "Bovines have long-been recognized as a key contributor to human schistosomiasis in Asia (Gray et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2006), and emerging evidence suggests they may be contributing to human schistosomiasis in Africa (Colley and Loker, 2018). Schistosomiasis is among the most burdensome helminth infections worldwide, with transmission being reported in a total of 78 countries in 2018 and approximately 230 million people in need of preventative treatment (World Health Organization, 2020). Although great strides have been made in the last few decades in global schistosomiasis control (World Health Organization, 2020), pockets of reemergent or persistent transmission highlight the need for careful consideration of possible local drivers of transmission (Kittur et al., 2019; Song et al., 2016). A poignant example is found in Schistosoma japonicum transmission in China, where despite well-established control programs and considerable progress towards elimination since the mid-1950s (Xu et al., 2016), a national report highlighted that there remained 450 endemic counties in 2020, a quarter of which had not achieved elimination criteria by year's end (Zhang et al., 2021). S. japonicum is transmitted by at least 40 species of wild and domestic mammals (Gray et al., 2009b), and animal activities near likely transmission sites may be important sources of reemergence and persistence. Although there are several domesticated and wild animals that can carry and transmit S. japonicum, (Li et al., 2015; Van Dorssen et al., 2017), estimates from Eastern China suggest that bovines may be responsible for as much as  $75\\%$  of human transmission (Guo et al., 2006). This substantial contribution is thought to be related to the high degree of environmental overlap between humans and bovines during agricultural production, as well as the large amount of fecal output of bovines, which is estimated to be as high as 100 times that of human fecal production each day (Gray et al., 2009b; He et al., 2001; Ross et al., 2001).

{"id": "221", "question": "The silver homolog premelanosome protein (PMEL, alternative names: Pmel-17, SILV, gp100 and ME20) has an important function in pigmentation of vertebrates. It is known that the protein is responsible for fibril formation within eumelanosomes [1], and it determines the elliptical eumelanosomal shape [2]. In contrast, pheomelanosomes show no fibril formation presumably due to the lack of PMEL expression [3]. The fibrillary structures laterally assemble into sheets, which serve as a matrix for eumelanin deposition (reviewed by Watt and co-workers [4]). Mutations in the PMEL gene are associated with coat color dilution in the mouse [5], chicken [6], dog [7] and horse [8]. In cattle, PMEL function seems to be unique because effects of genetic variants are not restricted to eumelanic coat color dilution as reported for other vertebrates. The non-synonymous mutation  $PMELc.64G > A$  (NM_001080215.2) in the signal peptide region of the bovine PMEL protein (NP_001073684) is causative for the Dilution locus (https://omia.org/OMIA001545/9913/), associated with extreme coat color dilution in the Charolais cattle breed [9]. A three-base-pair deletion c.50_52delTTC also in the N-terminal region of the bovine PMEL protein is responsible for coat color dilution in Highland and Galloway breeds [10]. These mutations in the bovine PMEL gene affect eumelanic as well as pheomelanic pigmentation [9-11]. This is remarkable because in other species pheomelanosomes are assumed to lack PMEL expression [3]. Furthermore, the PMEL locus has been identified as one component of a complex interaction of three loci underlying the genetic defect \"rat tail syndrome\" (RTS) in cattle (https://omia.org/OMIA001544/9913/) [12]. RTS is exclusively expressed in animals with a eumelanic background. This genetic defect was observed in calves produced by crossing animals from German Holstein with animals from the Charolais breed. The calves have short, curly, sometimes sparse hair, and a lack of normal tail hair development. Besides substantial effects on the hair structure, this defect is also associated with genetically-determined variation in coat color; animals with the RTS phenotype exhibit a darker grey (charcoal) coat color than animals without RTS phenotype.", "A": "Anatomy", "B": "Histology and Embryology", "C": "Physiology", "D": "Biochemistry", "E": "Pathology", "F": "Pharmacology", "G": "Microbiology", "H": "Parasitology", "I": "Public Health", "J": "Internal Medicine", "K": "Surgery", "L": "Obstetrics", "answer": "B"}

FCoV manifests as two closely related biotypes—the relatively apathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and the virulent FIP virus (FIPV) [1,2]. The relatively common FECV biotype replicates in feline intestinal enterocytes and is transmitted from cat to cat via the fecal-oral route [3,4]. According to the internal mutation hypothesis, the disease FIP is the result of genetic mutations in FECV, leading to a switch in viral host cell tropism from enterocytes to peritoneal-type macrophages, facilitating systemic spread and immunoinflammatory syndrome [5,6]. FIP is a complex, multi-systemic immuno-inflammatory disease characterized by fever, pyogranulomatous perivasculitis, effusion accumulation, fibrinous exudate and high mortality [3-5]. As a result of extensive systemic dissemination, FIP presents with clinical signs reflecting inflammation in multiple anatomic sites, including the abdominal cavity and associated viscera, thoracic cavity, central nervous system and/or eyes [5-8].", "A": "Anatomy", "B": "Histology and Embryology", "C": "Physiology", "D": "Biochemistry", "E": "Pathology", "F": "Pharmacology", "G": "Microbiology", "H": "Parasitology", "I": "Public Health", "J": "Internal Medicine", "K": "Surgery", "L": "Obstetrics", "answer": "G"}

The FCoVs usually inhabit the intestinal tract (feline enteric coronavirus, FECV). During viral replication within the enterocyte, a mutated variant, also called FIP virus (FIPV) may be generated (Pedersen, 2014a). Whichever is the exact mutation, FIPV loses tropism for enterocytes and gains the capability to replicate inside macrophages (Kipar et al., 2010). Moreover, FCoV induces macrophage-monocyte proliferation in haemo-lymphatic tissues and thus allow a progressive viral adaptation to the replication within these cells (Kipar and Meli, 2014). Although both viral biotypes (FECV and FIPV) can spread systemically, only the FIPV may induce FIP, due to the higher rate of interactions between the virus and monocytes. Moreover, the host immune response has a pivotal role in the development of the disease. Indeed, the cell-mediated immunity seems to be protective. On the other hand, it is known that the humoral response induces development of antibodies that enhance the in vitro virus uptake in macrophages and this, in turn, contributes in vivo to the development of the clinical signs seen during the effusive (wet) form of the disease. The non-effusive (dry) form is considered as an intermediate status involving a partially effective cellular response (Pedersen, 2014a).", "A": "Anatomy", "B": "Histology and Embryology", "C": "Physiology", "D": "Biochemistry", "E": "Pathology", "F": "Pharmacology", "G": "Microbiology", "H": "Parasitology", "I": "Public Health", "J": "Internal Medicine", "K": "Surgery", "L": "Obstetrics", "answer": "G"}

Brachial plexus dissections of two snow leopards (Panthera uncia) and two domestic cats (Felis catus) revealed that generally the morphology of the brachial plexus is quite conserved.

However, these viruses can also cause a life-threatening systemic illness with a high fatality rate in cats. FCoV associated with a fatal disease in cats, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), causes systemic pyogranulomatous inflammation in various organs, which subsequently progresses to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity and death. In contrast to the more common asymptomatic or mild enteritis caused by feline enteric coronavirus, the enteric biotype of FCoV, FIP is relatively uncommon in the general cat population, but it is the leading cause of death in young cats (1-3). In addition to the two biotypes of feline enteric coronavirus and FIP coronavirus, FCoVs are also classified into two serotypes, I and II. FCoV serotype I is more prevalent than serotype II, which appears to be derived from recombination with canine coronavirus in the spike (S) protein (4-8). Both serotypes can cause enteritis or FIP in domestic and wild feline populations, including wildcats, cheetahs, mountain lions, and leopards (9-11).

Cats (Felis catus) express three types of A3s: single-domain A3Z2, single-domain A3Z3, and double-domain A3Z2Z3. We proposed that FIV Vif would selectively interact with the Z2 and the Z3 A3s. Indeed, we identified two N-terminal Vif motifs (12LF13 and 18GG19) that specifically interacted with the FcaA3Z2 protein but not with A3Z3. In contrast, the exclusive degradation of FcaA3Z3 was regulated by a region of three residues (M24, L25, and I27).

Its progression commences with LDL deposition, endothelial dysfunction, subendothelial accumulation of foam cells, and formation of fatty streaks, under the activation of pro-inflammatory agents [4]. As the plaque progression continues, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) migrate into the intima and elaborate extracellular matrix. After decades, the fatty streak could progress into fibroatheroma lesions, characterized by the fibrous caps encompassing the lipid core [5]. At advanced stages, stable lesions have a small lipid core and a thick fibrous cap, while vulnerable lesions have the relatively thin fibrous cap and large lipid core. Once the fibrous cap rupture, a superimposed thrombosis could occlude the arterial lumens and disrupt blood flow, which is responsible for most morbidity and mortality of atherosclerosis. Overall, atherosclerosis could remain asymptomatic for decades before clinical manifestations even complicated lesions could be clinically overt, and some of the cases will only be diagnosed through a postmortem [7].", "A": "Anatomy", "B": "Histology and Embryology", "C": "Physiology", "D": "Biochemistry", "E": "Pathology", "F": "Pharmacology", "G": "Microbiology", "H": "Parasitology", "I": "Public Health", "J": "Internal Medicine", "K": "Surgery", "L": "Obstetrics", "answer": "E"}

STING is a membrane-related protein that contains four or five transmembrane regions, which are mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and partially located in mitochondria and mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) [4-7].

{"id": "250", "question": "Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (soluble) (PCK1) is a gluconeogenic gene that encodes the rate-limited enzyme PEPCK-C in gluconeogenesis (Hanson & Patel 1994). The role of  $PCK1$  in gluconeogenesis has been extensively reviewed (Hanson & Patel 1994), and it is well recognized that  $PCK1$  expression regulates plasma glucose level. For example, changing  $PCK1$  expression in the liver induces increased blood glucose (Valera et al. 1994) or hypoglycemia (Vidnes & Sovik 1976; She et al. 2000). Although  $PCK1$  has been linked to primarily gluconeogenesis, it has also been found in tissues that don't produce glucose, such as adipose tissue (Hanson & Reshef 2003; Reshef et al. 2003; Qu et al. 2016). Therefore, in addition to gluconeogenesis, other functions have been proposed for  $PCK1$ . Studies of the glyceroneogenesis have provided insight on the important role of  $PCK1$  in lipid metabolism. Glyceroneogenesis, which de novo synthesizes glycerol-3-phosphate from non-glucose or non-glycerol precursors, is a critical pathway for re-esterifying the free fatty acids released by adipose tissues during fasting conditions (Vaughan 1962; Ballard et al. 1967; Gorin et al. 1969).  $PCK1$  has been demonstrated to play important roles in this process. For example, She et al. (2000) found that mice with the deletion of  $PCK1$  in the liver presented a fatty liver because of the accumulation of fatty acid. Moreover, Olswang et al.

Viral hemagglutinin (HA) surface proteins bind to glycoprotein-linked sialic acid (SA) on the surface of host cells. The specific linkage of these sialic acids allows the virus to not only become specific to different host species, but also different tissues in these hosts. Humans express sialic acid  $\\alpha$ -2,6 linked galactose (SA  $\\alpha$ -2,6-Gal) surface molecules on epithelial cells in the upper airways, which is the site of replication for IAV in humans (Baum and Paulson, 1990; Couceiro et al., 1993). As such, strains of IAV that infect humans replicate in the upper airways. Birds, however, predominantly express SA  $\\alpha$ -2,3-Gal in their digestive tracts and lungs (Costa et al., 2012). Strains of IAV which are adapted to replicate in birds preferentially bind these receptors over human SA  $\\alpha$ -2,6-Gal receptors.

Following pathogen detection and subsequent IFN production, IFN molecules bind to their cell-surface receptors and rapidly initiate a signaling cascade via the Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, leading to the induction of expression of a wide variety of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Kisseleva et al., 2002; Schneider et al., 2014). Upon IFN binding, IFN receptors undergo conformational changes and subsequently form dimeric or oligomeric complexes, which lead to JAK apposition and transphosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues, releasing their intrinsic catalytic activity (Levy and Darnell, 2002; Piehler et al., 2012). The activated JAKs in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domains of IFN receptors, providing binding sites for the Src-homology-2 (SH2) domain of the STAT proteins (Bousoik and Montazeri Aliabadi, 2018). After binding to the receptors, STAT proteins are phosphorylated by JAKs. Phosphorylated STATs dissociate from the receptor-JAK complexes, form homo- or heterodimers, and then translocate to the nucleus where they complex with other nuclear proteins and bind to IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and gamma-activated sequence (GAS) to regulate hundreds of ISGs expression (Sands et al., 2006).

{"id": "266", "question": "Type I interferon (IFN) acts as the first line of defense against invading viral pathogens (Rasmussen et al., 2009; Schoggins and Rice, 2011). Once host molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as viral nucleic acids or proteins, a series of signaling pathways involving dozens of conserved adaptor molecules and kinases are activated rapidly, resulting in the expression of type I IFN (Akira et al., 2006; Medzhitov, 2007; Takeuchi and Akira, 2009). Type I IFN production during viral infection upregulated hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) expression via Janus kinase/signal transducer and activation of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway, many of which could directly kill viruses within infected cells (Schoggins and Rice, 2011; Theofilopoulos et al., 2005). In this pathway, type I IFNs binding leads to IFN receptors oligomerization, which triggers phosphorylation of JAK molecules (Cohen et al., 1995; Levy and Darnell, 2002). Activated JAKs subsequently phosphorylate the key tyrosine residues within the intracellular domains of IFN receptors, which serve as docking sites for STAT proteins (Darnell et al., 1994). Thus, JAKs in turn phosphorylate both STAT1 and STAT2 proteins (Schindler et al., 1992). The phosphorylated STAT proteins dimerize, interact with IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 9, and then form the ISG factor 3 (ISGF3) complex (Qureshi et al., 1995). This ISGF3 complex then migrates to the nucleus, where it binds to IFN-stimulated regulatory elements (ISREs) in the ISG promoters, resulting in the transcription of hundreds of ISGs to limit virus replication and spread (Martinez-Moczygemba et al., 1997; Schoggins and Rice, 2011).", "A": "Anatomy", "B": "Histology and Embryology", "C": "Physiology", "D": "Biochemistry", "E": "Pathology", "F": "Pharmacology", "G": "Microbiology", "H": "Parasitology", "I": "Public Health", "J": "Internal Medicine", "K": "Surgery", "L": "Obstetrics", "answer": "G"}

The family members differ in protein size and amino acid sequence; however, all share several consensus sequences surrounding the cysteine residues (Cys domain) and histidine residues (His domain) that are required for catalytic activity of the enzyme (Hochstrasser, 1996).

{"id": "269", "question": "The innate immune response is the first line of host defense against microbial pathogens. Various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play an essential role in detecting pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) associated with invading pathogens. PAMP recognition initiates an innate immune response, characterized by the production of type I interferon (IFN), proinflammatory cytokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (1, 2). PRRs comprise multiple family members, including toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and cytosolic dsDNA sensors (CDSs). RLRs primarily recognize  $5^{\\prime}$ -phosphorylated RNAs, including ssRNA or dsRNA produced during the replication of RNA or DNA viruses (3). Although RIG-I predominantly recognizes RNA viruses, the RIG-I/Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) pathway is also activated during infection with several DNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), Epstein-Barr virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (4-6). During infection with DNA viruses, RNA polymerase III recognizes AT-rich dsDNA and transcribes the dsDNA into dsRNA containing a 5-triphosphate moiety that activates the RIG-I/MAVS pathway to induce IFN- $\\beta$  production (7). DNA from viruses or bacteria can be detected by Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and potentially RLR, which potentially activate the endoplasmic reticulum-resident adaptor protein, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), to translocate from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, where it activates TBK1-IRF3 and -NF- $\\kappa$ B, resulting in robust induction of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokine production (8). IFN-I binds to IFNAR and activates R1-associated Tyk2 protein tyrosine kinase and the IFN-alpha/beta R2-associated Jak1 protein tyrosine kinase, which subsequently regulate the phosphorylation and activation of different STAT proteins; the activated STAT proteins homo- or heterodimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they promote the expression of numerous target genes. Binding of STAT proteins to either ISREs or GAS sites regulates the expression of several hundred ISGs, which mediate the anti-viral, anti-proliferative, and apoptotic effects of type I IFNs.", "A": "Anatomy", "B": "Histology and Embryology", "C": "Physiology", "D": "Biochemistry", "E": "Pathology", "F": "Pharmacology", "G": "Microbiology", "H": "Parasitology", "I": "Public Health", "J": "Internal Medicine", "K": "Surgery", "L": "Obstetrics", "answer": "G"}
{"id": "270", "question": "Buspirone is an anxioselective agent. Thus, unlike benzodiazepines, buspirone does not possess any anticonvulsant or muscle relaxant activity and little sedative or psychomotor impairment activity. Buspirone does not have significant affinity for benzodiazepine receptors and does not affect GABA binding. It appears to act as a partial agonist at serotonin (5-HT1A) receptors and as an agonist/antagonist of dopamine (D2) receptors in the CNS. In neurons, buspirone slows neuronal serotonin depletion. In a limited study done in 6 cats,4 oral administration of buspirone gave peak concentrations in ≈1.4 hours, but oral bioavailability appeared to be significantly lower than in humans. Transdermal administration of buspirone (PLO-base) did not yield detectable concentrations (ELISA method). However, a study comparing the effects of oral versus transdermal buspirone on urine marking indicated a significant reduction in urine marking frequency for both groups and there was no difference in efficacy between the two groups. This study administered the medication for 35 days and included 17 cats in each group.5 In humans, buspirone is rapidly and completely absorbed but a high first-pass effect limits systemic bioavailability to ≈5%. Binding to plasma proteins is very high (95%). In rats, the highest tissue concentrations are found in the lungs, kidneys, and fat. Lower concentrations are found in the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, plasma, and liver. The elimination half-life (in humans) is ≈2 to 4 hours.

{"id": "272", "question": "Bleomycin is an antibiotic that has activity against a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and some fungi; however, its cytotoxicity to eukaryote cells prevents it from being clinically useful as an antimicrobial drug. Bleomycin has both a DNA binding site and a site that binds to the ferrous form of iron. By serving as an electron acceptor from the ferrous ion to an oxygen atom in the DNA strand, bleomycin cleaves DNA and causes cellular apoptosis. Resistance to bleomycin can result from reduced cellular uptake of the drug, reduced ability to damage DNA, increased rates of DNA repair by the cell and drug inactivation by the enzyme bleomycin hydrolase. Because bleomycin is a cytotoxic agent with a low therapeutic index, it should only be used in clinical facilities able to actively monitor and handle potential complications. Bleomycin is contraindicated in patients with previous hypersensitivity reactions and should be used cautiously in patients with preexisting pulmonary disease or adverse pulmonary effects from prior therapy. Dosage reduction may be necessary for patients with significant renal impairment. Bleomycin can be teratogenic; it should only be used in pregnant animals when the owners accept the associated risks. A total cumulative bleomycin dose of 125 – 200 mg/m2 should not be exceeded in order to reduce the risk of pulmonary toxicity.

Should the latter be the case, it is better to attempt delivery with the posture uncorrected, for the forelegs will cause no greater obstruction lying alongside the chest than they would if extended; moreover, the subsequent traction, applied as it is to the head only, may cause the elbows alongside the head to become impacted at the pelvic inlet. Snare forceps are used as follows: The fetus is fixed at the pelvic brim by holding it through the abdominal wall; the closed forceps carrying the snare are passed into the uterus and over the fetal head until they lie above the neck. The jaws are then opened as widely as possible and depressed downwards until they lie ventral to the neck and are then closed. In this way, an encircling noose has been applied. By traction on the free ends of the snare, the noose is drawn tight, and it is held in position by the forceps.

In sows with large litters the smaller piglets can be expelled even when their fetal disposition is incorrect and as a result, simultaneous presentation of two piglets may become more frequent. Congenital abnormalities are very rare; they may include: arthrogryposis, hyperostosis, hydrocephalus, conjoined piglets, schistosoma reflexa, syndactyly, polydactyly, and micromelia (see Chapter 9). Arthrogryposis is characterised by ankylosis of various joints, in various degrees of flexion or extension, as well as the vertebral column resulting in lordosis, kyphosis, or scoliosis.
