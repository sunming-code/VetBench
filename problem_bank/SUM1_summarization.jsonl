{"query": "Rapid aeration of liquid-filled lungs at birth is mandatory for a successful transition from the fetal to the newborn state. Forceful inspiratory efforts (in which intrathoracic pressure as high as  $-90\\mathrm{cmH}_2\\mathrm{O}$  is generated by the newborn during the first respirations) create a pressure gradient within the airways, which moves air into the lungs. This in turn opens the alveoli and moves the liquid across the alveolar epithelium into the parenchyma. In addition, repetitive active expiratory laryngeal closure contributes to air-stacking in the lungs, ultimately maintaining a sufficient amount of air into the lung at the end of expiration, i.e. functional residual capacity. The presence of surfactant is crucial in this process; by decreasing the surface tension of the distal airways, the surfactant decreases the elastic recoil of the lung, hence decreasing expiratory emptying of the lung. At the same time, lung inflation and ventilation are responsible for an increase in pulmonary blood flow and the release of two potent pulmonary vasodilators, nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin, by the pulmonary endothelium (1), creating an optimal situation for alveolar-capillary gas exchange.", "response": "At birth, rapid aeration of fluid-filled lungs is essential for the transition from fetal to newborn life. Newborns generate very strong inspiratory efforts (up to −90 cmH₂O intrathoracic pressure) that create airway pressure gradients driving air into the lungs, opening alveoli and moving liquid across the alveolar epithelium into lung tissue. Repetitive active expiratory laryngeal closure promotes air-stacking, helping establish functional residual capacity (air remaining at end-expiration). Surfactant is critical by lowering distal airway surface tension, reducing lung elastic recoil and limiting expiratory lung emptying. Lung inflation/ventilation also increase pulmonary blood flow and stimulate pulmonary endothelial release of nitric oxide and prostacyclin, facilitating pulmonary vasodilation and optimal alveolar-capillary gas exchange."}

{"query": "The pre-implantation period is a coordinated process between fertilization and embryo implantation in the endometrium of mammalian species. The first cellular cycles of the fertilized oocyte are controlled by maternal RNAs and proteins synthesized and stored during oogenesis (Crosby et al., 1988). Around the fourth cell cycle in ruminants, the embryo begins to produce its own transcripts and maternal RNAs and proteins are degraded and replaced. This process is called maternal-to-embryonic transition (Graf et al., 2014; Sanchez et al., 2019), and its onset differs among species. In sheep, full activation of embryo transcription occurs at the 8-16 cell stage (Crosby et al., 1988). During the next cell divisions, E-cadherin membrane protein is responsible for cellular adhesion during sheep embryo compaction, being localized in all contact regions of blastomeres (Modina et al., 2010). At the morula stage, the compaction event induces cell polarization and blastomeres membranes are reorganized into apical and basolateral domains (Watson, 1992).

There is little direct experimental evidence in horses on how exercise alters drug disposition: prolonged submaximal exercise did not change frusemide plasma clearance measured minutes after exercise, but other studies show exercise affects physiological functions relevant to drug disposition. In horses, submaximal exercise significantly reduces hepatic blood flow, suggesting liver-extracted drugs may have reduced hepatic clearance during exercise. Evidence from humans shows glomerular filtration rate can drop by over 40% during mild exercise, implying renal elimination may also decrease. Because the liver and kidneys are primary drug-eliminating organs, sustained exercise-related cardiovascular adaptations may change drug disposition and lead to DTs different from those measured at rest."}
{"query": "Goat's milk is a rich source of bioactive compounds (peptides, conjugated linoleic acid, short chain fatty acids, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols such as phytoestrogens and minerals among others) that exert important health benefits. However, goat's milk composition depends on the type of food provided to the animal and thus, the abundance of bioactive compounds in milk depends on the dietary sources of the goat feed. The metabolic impact of goat milk rich in bioactive compounds during metabolic challenges such as a high-fat (HF) diet has not been explored. Thus, we evaluated the effect of milk from goats fed a conventional diet, a conventional diet supplemented with  $30\\%$  Acacia farnesiana (AF) pods or grazing on metabolic alterations in mice fed a HF diet. Interestingly, the incorporation of goat's milk in the diet decreased body weight and body fat mass, improved glucose tolerance, prevented adipose tissue hypertrophy and hepatic steatosis in mice fed a HF diet. These effects were associated with an increase in energy expenditure, augmented oxidative fibers in skeletal muscle, and reduced inflammatory markers. Consequently, goat's milk can be considered a non-pharmacologic strategy to improve the metabolic alterations induced by a HF diet. Using the body surface area normalization method gave a conversion equivalent daily human intake dose of 1.4 to 2.8 glasses (250 mL per glass/day) of fresh goat milk for an adult of 60 kg, which can be used as reference for future clinical studies.", "response": "Goat milk contains many bioactive compounds with health benefits, but its composition varies with the goat’s diet.

Adding goat milk reduced body weight and fat mass, improved glucose tolerance, and prevented adipose tissue hypertrophy and liver steatosis; these benefits were linked to higher energy expenditure, more oxidative skeletal muscle fibers, and lower inflammatory markers. The authors conclude goat milk may be a non-pharmacologic strategy to counter HF-diet–induced metabolic alterations, with a human-equivalent reference intake of about 1.4–2.8 glasses/day (250 mL each) for a 60 kg adult."}
{"query": "The equine thoracolumbar spine acts like a flexible bow that is maintained in a slightly arched (rounded) position by tension in the string, formed by the abdominal and sublumbar muscles. Concentric contraction of these muscles rounds the back by flexing the intervertebral joints. Insufficient tension in the string allows the weight of the viscera to extend the intervertebral joints, and the back contour becomes more lordotic. It is desirable for horses to work in a rounded posture to maintain separation of the dorsal spinous processes, so the use of conditioning exercises that recruit and strengthen the hypaxial musculature is an important part of athletic training. In horses that have poor natural posture or weak, inactive hypaxial muscles, for example, following colic surgery or foaling, the rehabilitation program should target activation and strengthening of these muscles.

When these muscles contract concentrically, they flex the intervertebral joints and round the back; if muscle tension is insufficient, the weight of the viscera extends the joints, creating a more lordotic back contour. A rounded working posture is desirable because it helps maintain separation of the dorsal spinous processes, so conditioning exercises that recruit and strengthen the hypaxial musculature are important in athletic training.

Clinicians and horse owners must recognize the presence of these risk factors so that they can be targeted and controlled to reduce the risk of laminitis attacks. Diagnosis of EMS is based partly on the horse's history and clinical examination findings, and partly on laboratory testing. Several choices of test exist which examine different facets of ID and other related metabolic disturbances. EMS is controlled mainly by dietary strategies and exercise programs that aim to improve insulin regulation and decrease obesity where present. In some cases, pharmacologic aids might be useful.

{"query": "Sequencing the genome of a Quarter Horse was considered important for several reasons. Almost 3 million Quarter Horses were registered in the United States in 2010 according to the American Quarter Horse Association, making it the single largest breed registry in the country [2,3]. When one includes non-registered Quarter Horses and other Quarter Horse-influenced breed registries (e.g., American Paint Horse Association), the Quarter Horse is by far the largest contributor to the population of horses in the United States. Although Quarter Horse breeding was, and continues to be, strongly influenced by Thoroughbred bloodlines, the 2 breeds were selectively bred to enhance different traits. Thoroughbred breeding has selected for speed over distances of  $3/4$  to 2 miles, whereas selection in the Quarter Horse has emphasized speed over shorter distances and compliant disposition suited to working cattle and other ranch-related duties [4]. Thus, there are important phenotypic differences between the breeds that have been achieved by selective breeding with a clear underlying genetic component [5,6]. Moreover, there are single-gene disorders in Quarter Horses, such as polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM) [7,8], hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP) [9], glycogen branching enzyme deficiency (GBED) [10], and hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia (HERDA) [11,12]. Most diseases and traits (such as predisposition to osteoarthritis or body-type) are complex, involving multiple genes, which may be modulated by environmental factors [5,13,14]. Thus, identifying genetic variants in the genome of a single Quarter Horse would provide a wealth of information for future genomic studies in equids.", "response": "Sequencing a Quarter Horse genome was considered important because Quarter Horses are the largest horse population contributor in the United States (about 3 million registered in 2010, plus many unregistered and related breed registries). Although influenced by Thoroughbred bloodlines, Quarter Horses and Thoroughbreds have been selectively bred for different traits—Thoroughbreds for longer-distance speed and Quarter Horses for short-distance speed and a compliant ranch-working disposition—creating phenotypic differences with a genetic basis. Quarter Horses also have several known single-gene disorders (PSSM, HYPP, GBED, HERDA), while many other traits and disease risks are complex and affected by multiple genes and environment. Therefore, identifying genetic variants from one Quarter Horse genome would provide valuable information for future equine genomic research."}

{"query": "A major cause of concern regarding the forces associated with horseback riding is that vascular occlusion may occur when the applied pressure exceeds the mean capillary pressure of $4.7\\mathrm{kPa}$ (Chang and Siegreg, 1999). Prolonged vascular occlusion can lead to ischemia, oxygen and nutrient deprivation, and ultimately necrosis of the under-lying tissues with muscle being particularly vulnerable to pressure-induced injury (Linder-Ganz et al., 2006). Thus, it is important to seek metrics that are predictive for saddle-induced damage to underlying tissues. Minimal, maximal and mean pressures beneath the saddle have been suggested as relevant measures, with mean pressure showing the largest difference between saddle variants (Byström et al., 2010). Mean pressure is also more reliable than maximal pressure (De Cocq et al., 2006) and it differentiates more clearly between groups of horses with and without back pain (von Peinen et al., 2010). Based on published data (Mönkemöller et al., 2005; Nyikos et al., 2005; Meschan et al., 2007), it has been suggested that mean pressure $>11\\mathrm{kPa}$ is a reasonable threshold to indicate a risk of inducing back pain (Byström et al., 2010).", "response": "Vascular occlusion during horseback riding may occur if saddle pressure exceeds mean capillary pressure (4.7 kPa); if prolonged, this can cause ischemia, oxygen/nutrient deprivation, and tissue necrosis, with muscle especially vulnerable.

Reasons may include primary thoracolumbar osseous pathology (Gillen et al., 2009; Girodroux et al., 2009; Meehan et al., 2009; Zimmerman et al., 2011a,b), or back muscle soreness developed secondarily to lameness, incorrect training, a poorly skilled rider, a saddle not fitting the horse and/or a saddle not fitting the rider. However, there is a lack of scientific data relating directly to riders. Both experimentally-induced forelimb or hindlimb lameness (Gómez Alvarez et al., 2007, 2008) and back pain/stiffness have been shown to alter the biomechanics of the spine and shift the centre of gravity (Wennerstrand et al., 2004, 2009). This may predispose to rider back pain or stiffness (Lagarde et al., 2005; Symes and Ellis, 2009) and abnormal saddle movement, such as saddle slip consistently to one side (Greve and Dyson, 2012).

While some authors show evidence that infection and destruction of megakaryocytes may play a role (Rodriguez et al., 1996a), other researchers did not find structural or ultrastructural correlates for an impaired thrombocytopoiesis (Gomez-Villamandos et al., 1997a). Pigs infected with ASFV generally suffer from severe lymphopenia that could be attributed to apoptosis of lymphocytes.

{"query": "Clostridium difficile is considered one of the most important causes of diarrhea and enterocolitis in horses. Foals and adult horses are equally susceptible to the infection. The highly resistant spore of  $C$  difficile is the infectious unit of transmission, which occurs primarily via the fecal-oral route, with sources of infection including equine feces, contaminated soil, animal hospitals, and feces of other animals. Two major risk factors for the development of  $C$  difficile associated disease (CDAD) in adult horses are hospitalization and antimicrobial treatment, although sporadically, cases of CDAD can occur in horses that have not received antimicrobials or been hospitalized. The most common antibiotics associated with CDAD in horses are erythromycin, trimethoprim/sulfonamides,  $\\beta$ -lactam antimicrobials, clindamycin, rifampicin, and gentamicin. Clinical signs and intestinal lesions of CDAD infection are not specific and they cannot be used to distinguish infections by  $C$  difficile from infections by other agents, such as Clostridium perfringens or Salmonella sp. The distribution of lesions throughout the intestinal tract seems to be age-dependent. Small intestine is invariably affected, and colon and cecum may or may not have lesions in foals  $< 1$ -month old. Naturally acquired disease in older foals and adult horses has a more aboral distribution, affecting colon and sometimes cecum, but rarely the small intestine. Detection of toxin A, toxin B or both in intestinal contents or feces is considered the most reliable diagnostic criterion for CDAD in horses. Isolation of toxigenic strains of  $C$  difficile from horses with intestinal disease is highly suggestive of CDAD. A better understanding of pathogenesis, reservoirs of infection, and vaccines and other methods of control is needed. Also further studies are recommended to investigate other possible predisposing factors and/or etiological agents of enteric diseases of horses.", "response": "Clostridium difficile is a major cause of diarrhea and enterocolitis in horses, with foals and adults equally susceptible.

Clinical signs and intestinal lesions are nonspecific and cannot reliably distinguish C. difficile infection from other causes (e.g., Clostridium perfringens or Salmonella). Lesion distribution varies with age: in foals under 1 month the small intestine is always affected and colon/cecum may or may not be involved, while in older foals and adults lesions are more aboral, mainly affecting the colon and sometimes the cecum, with small-intestine involvement being rare. The most reliable diagnosis is detection of toxin A, toxin B, or both in intestinal contents or feces; isolating toxigenic C. difficile from horses with intestinal disease is strongly suggestive.

{"query": "The most widely studied TLR is TLR4 which, together with its accessory receptor, MD-2, responds to monomeric endotoxins. Naturally occurring LPS, a vital component of the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria, is made up of 3 distinct structural parts. $^{16}$  The outermost polysaccharide O antigen domain of LPS is a repetitive glycan polymer that varies from strain to strain and is a target for recognition by host antibodies; this is connected to a core domain that consists of less variant oligosaccharides. The innermost component of LPS, Lipid A, is a phosphorylated glucosamine disaccharide attached to up to 6 hydrophobic fatty acids. Lipid A anchors the LPS molecule into the bacterial cell membrane, is responsible for many of the toxic effects of gram-negative bacteria, and is the smallest ligand recognized by TLR4/MD-2. Having both hydrophobic lipid and hydrophilic sugar moieties, LPS forms micelles in aqueous solutions. These features of LPS are important for the regulation of its movement in the circulation and its interaction with cells. Binding of LPS to TLR4 initiates cell-signaling cascades (see later discussion), activation of the cell, and the synthesis of mediators associated with inflammation.

{"query": "The evolution of pandemic viruses requires a 'perfect ecological storm' in which multiple host populations perform at least two key functions: (a) generating and sustaining viral diversity and (b) transmitting viral diversity to humans. Reservoir hosts serve the former role, harboring high viral genetic diversity but with low rates of direct contact with humans (such as wild birds, bats, or rodents) (5). Intermediary hosts are typically livestock or domestic animals that serve the latter role: they often harbor only a subset of the viral diversity that circulates in reservoir hosts yet are capable of transmitting viral diversity to humans via high rates of contact (1). In the United States, commercial swine serve as reservoir hosts, and exhibition swine effectively serve as intermediary hosts. Commercial swine are produced for food production exclusively in a year-round system that is highly conducive to the evolution and sustained transmission of genetically diverse viruses (6), but less conducive to zoonotic transmission, with high biosecurity and less frequent contact with humans. In contrast, exhibition swine effectively serve as intermediary hosts because they are raised and exhibited in a system with low biosecurity that maximizes human contact (7, 8) but purges genetic diversity and host immunity at the end of the summer show season when exhibition swine finish showing and a new cohort of swine are raised for next year (9). A production system in which commercial and exhibition swine are occasionally raised together provides opportunities for genetically diverse viruses to end up at county fairs and find their way into humans (10-12).", "response": "Pandemic viruses tend to emerge under a “perfect ecological storm” in which different host populations (1) generate and sustain viral genetic diversity and (2) transmit that diversity to humans. Reservoir hosts (e.g., wild birds, bats, rodents) maintain high viral diversity but have relatively little direct human contact, while intermediary hosts (often livestock/domestic animals) carry a subset of that diversity but have frequent human contact enabling spillover. In the United States, commercial swine function as reservoir hosts because year-round, high-throughput production supports evolution and sustained circulation of diverse viruses, yet high biosecurity limits zoonotic transmission. Exhibition swine function as intermediary hosts because low biosecurity and intense human contact promote transmission to people, though viral diversity and immunity are reduced when the show season ends and animals are replaced. Occasional mixing of commercial and exhibition swine can move diverse viruses into county fairs, creating pathways for human infection."}

The cuticle thickness on the eggs of domestic hens varies from 0.5 to 12.8 μm and can have an uneven or patchy distribution on the eggshell surface (Board and Halls 1973). Theoretically, the cuticle subserves diverse functions, varying from reducing water loss to the first lines of defense against bacterial penetration by blocking the external surface of pores (Kulshreshtha et al. 2018).

{"query": "Currently, aquaculture is the fastest growing animal food sector worldwide (FAO 2014). However, fish and shellfish production is limited by several emerging diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, amoebas and other ectoparasites. Bacterial fish diseases are typically addressed by antibiotics (Romero et al. 2012; Cabello et al. 2013), viral diseases by vaccination (Evensen and Leong 2013) and parasitic diseases by chemical treatment (Burridge et al. 2010).

Six SAV subtypes have been identified based on the nucleic acid sequences encoding proteins E2 and nsP3 (Fringuelli et al. 2008), namely SAV subtypes 1-6. The SAV subtype 2 is divided into two subgroups: the freshwater variant, SAV2 FW, and the marine variant, marine SAV2. SAV2 FW typically causes sleeping disease (SD) in freshwater-reared rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum)) in England, Scotland and a number of countries on the European mainland (Graham et al. 2007a). Marine SAV2 typically causes PD in seawater-reared Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and rainbow trout. This paper focuses on PD, therefore only covering SAV infections in the seawater phase. The current distribution of SAV subtypes is shown in Fig. 1. SAV 1, 4, and 6 have been identified in conjunction with Irish PD outbreaks, while SAV 1, 4, 5 and marine SAV2 have been associated with Scottish outbreaks (Fringuelli et al. 2008). SAV 3 has so far only been detected in Norway (Hodneland et al. 2005; Weston et al. 2005; Karlsen et al. 2006, 2014; Jansen et al. 2010a), where outbreaks caused by marine SAV2 are also seen (Hjortaas et al. 2013, 2016).", "response": "Pancreas disease (PD) is a viral disease affecting farmed salmonids during the seawater phase in Ireland, Norway, and Scotland.

{"query": "Paravertebral anaesthesia involves the injection of a local anaesthetic alongside the dorsal and ventral rami of the spinal nerves at T13, L1 and L2 as they emerge from the intervertebral foramina. The technique produces analgesia of the body wall including the parietal peritoneum. The patient remains standing and fully conscious. The GSA neurons that have touch and pain receptors in the body wall are anaesthetised in the localised area. The anaesthetised ventral rami (T13, L1, L2) contain GSE neurons that innervate the striated muscle in the localised region of the body wall. The parasympathetic system does not have any neurons in the thoracolumbar spinal nerves. The sympathetic system does have preganglionic motor neurons within the ventral roots of the thoracolumbar spinal cord. However, the ratio of pre-­ to postganglionic sympathetic neurons is about 1:20 so that the system is capable of a widespread response or a compensation for the anaesthetised neurons. The result is that, whereas the GSA and GSE neurons are effectively anaesthetised, there are plenty of sympathetic GVA neurons to maintain function.", "response": "Paravertebral anaesthesia is performed by injecting a local anaesthetic near the dorsal and ventral rami of the T13, L1, and L2 spinal nerves as they exit the intervertebral foramina, producing analgesia of the body wall (including the parietal peritoneum) while the patient remains standing and fully conscious.

{"query": "The actual mechanism by which the descent of the testes occurs has been the subject of debate for many years and the object of much research. It is clear that there is considerable variation between species not least because of anatomical and physiological differences. Endocrine factors certainly appear to have a significant role. The requirement for the descent of the mammalian testes to an extra-­abdominal location is due to the need to lower the temperature by 2–3°C of the body temperature for spermatogenesis (see Section 5). However, the testes of the elephant and the hyrax are intra-­abdominal. Inguinal passage occurs at about 120 days of pregnancy in the ox, 80 days in the sheep and 90 days in the pig. In the horse, however, the testis is drawn to the inguinal ring, but at 100–120 days the foetal gonad starts to enlarge rapidly and is unable to pass through the inguinal canal. The gonads reach maximum size at about 210–240 days of pregnancy. The testes then undergo shrinkage until inguinal passage is possible at about 300 days, although some distortion of the testes is still necessary. By the time the foal is born the testes are normally through the inguinal canal.", "response": "The mechanism of testicular descent is debated, varies between species due to anatomical and physiological differences, and likely involves important endocrine factors. Descent to an extra-abdominal location in most mammals is needed to keep testes about 2–3°C cooler than body temperature for spermatogenesis, though some species (elephant and hyrax) retain intra-abdominal testes. Timing of inguinal passage differs by species: about 120 days of gestation in cattle, 80 days in sheep, and 90 days in pigs. In horses, the testes are drawn to the inguinal ring, but rapid fetal gonad enlargement at 100–120 days prevents passage; they reach maximum size at 210–240 days, then shrink until passage becomes possible around 300 days (often requiring some distortion), and by birth the testes are usually through the inguinal canal."}

Examination of the paw generally consists of assessing each digit, including the nail and nail bed. Common sources of lame­ ness arising from these sites include: Split nails, Nail‐bed tumors, Fracture/luxation of the phalanges, Infection, Penetrating foreign bodies, Pad lacerations. Nails are inspected for signs of wear, which may indicate digit dragging due to neurologic disorders (Figure 1).

{"query": "The majority of MCTs originate in the dermis and extend into the subcutis, but there is a subset that is restricted to the subcutaneous fat and are classified as a subtype in their own right – subcutaneous MCTs. This is determined on the basis of location within the subcutaneous tissue and no invasion of the dermis, although multifocal extension of low numbers of mast cells around the base of hair follicles or mast cells infiltrating the underlying panniculus musculature is allowed, as long as the bulk of the tumour is within the subcutaneous tissue. There is no supporting evidence for the usefulness of grading these tumours with any of the cutaneous grading systems, but a few studies have looked at the prognostication of subcutaneous MCTs as a separate entity. Tumours should be assessed based on the growth pattern, presence of multinucleation (defined as more than 1 nuclei per cell, present if there was at least 1 multinucleated cell in 10 HPFs [400×]), and the mitotic count. The strongest effect on clinical outcome appears to be mitotic activity. Subcutaneous tumours are more effectively controlled by surgery alone than their cutaneous counterparts. Surgery is curative for the majority of these tumours.", "response": "Subcutaneous mast cell tumours (MCTs) are a distinct subset of MCTs confined mainly to subcutaneous fat without dermal invasion; limited mast cell extension around hair follicle bases or into underlying panniculus musculature is acceptable as long as most of the tumour remains subcutaneous. There is no evidence that cutaneous MCT grading systems are useful for these tumours, so some studies evaluate them separately for prognosis. Assessment should focus on growth pattern, multinucleation (>1 nucleus per cell; considered present if at least one multinucleated cell is seen in 10 high-power fields at 400×), and mitotic count, with mitotic activity having the strongest impact on clinical outcome.

The second reaction removes a free glucose residue from glycogen which can be quickly phosphorylated to Glc-6-P and used in the Embden-Meyerhoff pathway (EMP), or released by liver tissue into blood (Fig. 23-4). Additionally, Glc-6-P may also be dephosphorylated by hepatic Glu-6-Pase, and released as free glucose into blood.

However, it is also seen accumulating secondary to other causes of hepatopathy. Therefore, the finding of copper in and of itself is not diagnostic for a primary copper associated hepatopathy. There is a difference in the quantity and distribution of copper accumulation seen in primary copper associated hepatopathy as opposed to secondary, but in my experience, it can be sometimes difficult to confidently distinguish between the two, particularly if other changes to the hepatic parenchyma are also severe and distort the lobular architecture and/or in Tru­cut biopsies with few intact lobules. It is very important to assess for the presence of copper, as chelating agents are a potential therapeutic option, regardless of whether the accumulation is primary or secondary. Special staining for copper (typically with stains such as rhodanine, or rubeanic acid) is typically performed on canine liver biopsies for this reason. These special stains detect the presence of copper, the distribution (periportal versus centrilobular), and can allow for a subjective assessment of the severity of any such accumulation. Assessment also entails identifying which cells are accumulating the copper (macrophages and/or hepatocytes) and whether its presence is associated with necrotic hepatocytes, and formation of small ‘copper granulomas’.", "response": "Copper can accumulate in the livers of dogs with chronic hepatopathies either as a primary disease (primary copper-associated hepatopathy, increasingly recognized in more breeds) or secondary to other liver disorders, so copper presence alone is not diagnostic.

For active infection, treat 2–3 times weekly for 3–4 weeks, then reduce to 1–2 times weekly for maintenance/prevention; shampoo is preferred for generalized disease and wipes for facial folds, claw folds, and interdigital areas. In dogs, the most effective oral options are ketoconazole or itraconazole (both 5–10 mg/kg/day), with itraconazole generally better tolerated though both can cause GI upset; fluconazole (5–10 mg/kg/day) may have fewer adverse effects/interactions but may be less reliable, and terbinafine (30 mg/kg/day) is less effective for surface infections due to low stratum corneum/sebum levels. Oral treatment is typically daily for 20–30 days, then may continue as pulse therapy 1–3 times per week if needed. Compounded azole formulations should be avoided because of poor bioavailability."}
{"query": "Idiopathic Megaesophagus Idiopathic megaesophagus is the most common cause of regurgitation in the dog.10 Aside from dysautonomia, megaesophagus is a rare finding in the domestic cat. The disorder is characterized by esophageal hypomotility and dilation, progressive regurgitation, and loss of body condition. Several forms of the syndrome have been described, including congenital, acquired secondary, and acquired idiopathic megaesophagus. Dysautonomia Dysautonomia is a generalized autonomic neuropathy that was originally reported in cats in the United Kingdom, but that has now been documented in dogs and cats throughout Western Europe and the United States.11,12 Clinical signs reflect a generalized autonomic dysfunction but megaesophagus, esophageal hypomotility, and regurgitation are fairly consistent findings. Pathologically, degenerative lesions are found in autonomic ganglia, intermediate gray columns of the spinal cord, and some sympathetic axons. No definitive etiology has ever been established despite an intensive search for genetic, toxic, nutritional, and infectious etiologic agents. Gastroesophageal Intussusception Gastroesophageal intussusception is a rare condition of young dogs (most younger than 3 months of age) resulting from invagination of stomach into the esophagus, with or without other abdominal organs (e.g., spleen, duodenum, pancreas, omentum).17 Many affected animals have preexisting esophageal disease, most importantly idiopathic megaesophagus. The role of idiopathic megaesophagus in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal intussusception is not well understood, but it may be that the greatly enlarged capacity of a dilated esophagus accommodates invagination of the stomach through the diaphragmatic hiatus. Gastroesophageal intussusception is a true gastrointestinal emergency that may culminate in death if untreated.", "response": "Idiopathic megaesophagus is the most common cause of regurgitation in dogs but is rare in cats except with dysautonomia; it involves esophageal hypomotility and dilation leading to progressive regurgitation and loss of body condition, and occurs as congenital, acquired secondary, or acquired idiopathic forms. Dysautonomia is a generalized autonomic neuropathy first reported in UK cats and now seen in dogs and cats in Western Europe and the U.S.; it causes widespread autonomic dysfunction with consistent megaesophagus, esophageal hypomotility, and regurgitation, and shows degenerative lesions in autonomic ganglia, intermediate gray columns of the spinal cord, and some sympathetic axons, with no confirmed etiology despite investigation of genetic, toxic, nutritional, and infectious causes. Gastroesophageal intussusception is a rare emergency in young dogs (usually <3 months) where the stomach invaginates into the esophagus, sometimes with other organs; many cases have preexisting esophageal disease (especially idiopathic megaesophagus), which may permit stomach invagination due to an enlarged, dilated esophagus, and it can be fatal if untreated."}
{"query": "A Wood’s lamp examination is one of the simplest screening tools for dermatophytosis, but is only useful for some strains of \\(M.\\) canis, since only \\(M.\\) canis produces the classic emerald or apple-­green fluorescence of the hair shaft (Figure 9). In the hands of a skilled user, a Wood’s lamp will detect positive \\(M.\\) canis infection approximately 70–100% of the time (Moriello et al. 2017). Unfortunately, lint, skin surface crust and debris, and topical medications can cause similar fluorescence, which can lead to false positive results. Glowing hairs should be plucked and examined under the microscope for confirmation of the diagnosis. Hairs treated with appropriate topical therapy will not cease to fluoresce; but only the infected portion will glow, so a simple trick for monitoring response to treatment is to watch for loss of fluorescence as hairs grow out. Direct microscopic evaluation of infected hairs is another reliable diagnostic tool in the hands of a skilled examiner. Hairs from the edge of a lesion are plucked and placed on a slide with mineral oil and a coverslip. They are evaluated for the presence of hyphae and arthrospores on 100× power. Lowering and closing the condenser can increase contrast, which allows spores and hyphae to stand out. Infected hairs tend to be larger in diameter with a fuzzy or irregular outline, and they lack a clear demarcation between the cortex and the medulla. Most dermatophyte infections in animals produce an ectothrix distribution of arthrospores: coccoid elements surrounding the outside of the hair shaft.

{"query": "Nursery pigs and growers very often show sneezing and catarrhal nasal discharge as the first clinical sign after an infection with M. hyorhinis. They might exhibit fewer, reduced feed intake and depression for up to 10–14 days, before they recover in case of no further complications. In case of a concurrent infection with a primary respiratory pathogen, M. hyorhinis is also found in the lower airways and might contribute to the pathogenesis of pneumonia, and thereby to the severity of coughing and dyspnoea. When the infection becomes systemic, M. hyorhinis can cause pleuritis, which further enhances the respiratory symptoms attributed to pneumonia provoked by a primary respiratory pathogen. Apart from this, pigs often demonstrate a pathological posture with their back curved upwards due to peritonitis and they suffer from pericarditis and lameness because of (poly-) arthritis (Fig. 2). In case of polyserositis and polyarthritis, symptoms often last for more than 6 weeks. Suckling pigs and adult pigs seldom suffer from an infection with M. hyorhinis.

{"query": "Macrolide antibiotics and similar molecules are active against gram-­positive (S. aureus, Streptococcus spp.) and atypical pathogens (Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma spp.), but have a limited spectrum against gram-­negative organisms. Macrolides are ineffective against enteric gram-­ negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli and are ineffective against P. aeruginosa. They are active against fastidious gram-­negative organisms (Campylobacter spp., Borrelia spp., Bordetella spp., Brucella spp., Pasteurella spp., Haemophilus spp., H. pylori) and spirochetes (Treponema pallidum). Some differences exist in the overlapping spectrums of each macrolide antibiotic. Macrolides and their relatives are bacteriostatic agents that block bacterial protein synthesis. Macrolides may also inhibit production of bacterial virulence factors (Kanoh and Rubin 2010), may have anti-­inflammatory properties (Rubin and Tamaoki 2000; Culić et al. 2001), immunomodulatory activity (Piacentini et al. 2007), and effects on cell signaling (Clapham 2007). Resistance to macrolides and related compounds occurs in three ways (Nakajima 1999; Leclercq and Courvalin 2002). The first is target site modification by methylation or other mutation that prevents binding of the drug to the ribosomal target. For example, the A2059G mutation confers high-­level resistance to macrolides such as erythromycin and azithromycin, moderate resistance to clarithromycin and clindamycin, but no resistance to streptogramins (Tait-­Kamradt et al. 2000; Canu et al. 2002). The second is efflux mediated by physiologic pumps that actively pump the drug out of the bacterial cell and are encoded by the mef (A) gene with efflux driven by proton motive force (Clancy et al. 1996). The third is drug inactivation by degradation from hydrolysis of the macrolide lactone ring or drug modification related to macrolide phosphorylation. Macrolide inactivation is rare and less common than other mechanisms of macrolide resistance.", "response": "Macrolide antibiotics (and related molecules) are mainly active against gram-positive bacteria (e.g., *S. aureus*, *Streptococcus* spp.) and atypical pathogens (*Chlamydia*, *Mycoplasma*), but have limited activity against gram-negative organisms; they are ineffective against enteric gram-negative bacilli such as *E. coli* and against *P. aeruginosa*.

Macrolides are bacteriostatic agents that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis and may also reduce virulence factor production, have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and influence cell signaling.

{"query": "H. parasuis strains are heterogeneous and exhibit a wide variability in the degree of virulence, from non-virulent to highly virulent strains. Non-virulent strains are commonly found in the upper respiratory tract as part of the normal microbiota of the animals, where do not cause any pathology. These strains are susceptible to the killing action of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) and, under normal conditions, are effectively cleared from the lungs (Fig. 4). If these strains reach the lung, they are detected by PAM, which are then activated for an effective phagocytosis and killing. Non-virulent strains are also sensitive to serum, and cannot survive in blood for systemic dissemination. These characteristics explain why non-virulent strains are not able to cause disease in healthy animals and are controlled by the innate immune system. On the opposite side, virulent strains can evade the immune system and cause disease. After the initial colonization of the upper respiratory tract, virulent strains can reach the lung, where they survive due to their ability to resist phagocytosis. After nasal inoculation, virulent strains can be found colonizing not only the nasal mucosa, but also the tracheal mucosa, where they can form biofilm-like structures. When virulent strains reach the lung, they are confronted by PAM. The interaction between virulent \\(H.\\) parasuis and PAM is limited and macrophage activation is delayed. During lung infection, \\(H.\\) parasuis adapt its metabolism to survive in the lung environment and express the necessary virulence factors to resist host defences (Fig. 4). Bacterial capsule and two surface proteins from the trimeric autotransporter family, named VtaA8 and VtaA9 (virulence-associated trimeric autotransporters o VtaA), play a role in phagocytosis resistance. Survival of virulent \\(H.\\) parasuis in the lung induces inflammation, including neutrophil recruitment, which may result in suppurative bronchopneumonia. The study of cellular location of virulent \\(H.\\) parasuis in the lung has shown that it can be found associated with neutrophils and macrophages, but also with pneumocytes.

{"query": "The fracture reduction can be achieved either by closed, open, or semi-open method. Reduction of fracture without incising the skin or exposing the bone, through external manipulation, is called closed reduction. The technique involves holding the major bone segments over the skin, separating the impacted broken ends by traction if needed and then aligning them to the near normal anatomical position. Normally, after a closed reduction, fracture is immobilized with an external fixation technique, although in certain internal fixation, reduction can be achieved externally as in fresh cases of incomplete/greenstick fractures of femur in young animals without bone displacement. Closed reduction is generally indicated in fresh lower limb fractures, comprising only two bone pieces with little or no overriding of the bone segments. Closed reduction is done only when the bone segments are easily palpable with less muscular coverage.

Some breeds that develop congenital laryngeal paralysis are affected by a generalized polyneuropathy (Table 1), and in the acquired idiopathic form, several studies have now confirmed the generalized nature of the neurologic deficits. Electromyographic studies and nerve conduc­ tion velocities in peripheral limb musculature of dogs with acquired laryngeal paralysis are suggestive of axonal disease (Jeffrey et al. 2006; Thieman et al. 2010). It has been recognized that affected older, large breed dogs often dis­ play clinical signs and physical examination findings of esophageal dysfunction and decreased proprioceptive placing, supporting a more generalized neurologic defect (Stanley et al. 2010).

Surgical removal of the digit is a more humane option. It is vital that this surgery is not attempted if there is sepsis in the proximal joints, as pain will then persist. If clinicians are in any doubt, radiography should be carried out. Regional anaesthesia can be used. The distal limb can be cleaned but full asepsis is not required. A length of embryotomy wire is placed between the digits. The sawing direction should be at an angle of 45° above the horizontal. The skin, soft tissue and half the second phalanx should be removed. The foot then should be bandaged before removal of the tourniquet. The animal should be given antibiotic and NSAID cover for a minimum of 1 week.

{"query": "The most common abnormal urine color is pink, red, or reddish brown and can be attributed to intact red blood cells (RBC), hemolyzed RBC, muscle pigments, food pigments, or porphyrins (Figure 3). The most common cause of pink to red urine is the presence of intact RBC (hematuria) (Figure 4.4a–e). Intact RBC in urine impart a pink to brown color to urine, depending on the number of RBC, urine pH, and length of time the RBC have been in the urine [2]. A substantial number of RBC must be present in urine before a pink or red color is observed (Figure 4.5). Light pink color was observed in urine from dogs when approximately 600 RBC/hpf were present in the urine sediment and dark pink color was observed when 800–950 RBC/hpf were present [14]. Red color from intact RBC in urine clears with centrifugation or settling (Figure 4.6). Hemoglobinuria from intravascular hemolysis or lysis of previously intact red cells in the urine specimen (in vivo or in vitro) also may cause reddish color that persists in the supernatant after settling or centrifugation (Figure 4.7a,b). Uncommonly, the presence of myoglobinuria, or rarely porphyrinuria, may cause a reddish color (see also Chapter 5, occult blood). Rarely, dyes used in the manufacture of some dry dog foods or ingestion of an unusual food item will impart a pink color to the urine. Discoloration caused by free hemoglobin, myoglobin, porphyrin, or dyes will persist in the urine supernatant after centrifugation, because they are dissolved in the urine. The term “beeturia” has been used to describe pink to deep red discolored urine from human patients after eating beets or foods that have been colored with beet pigments. Betacyanuria is the preferred scientific term that describes these red pigments in urine. Betanin and its epimer isobetanin contribute most of this red color. Urine can become progressively pinker when beetroot pigments are exposed to sunlight. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can be used to definitively identify beetroot pigments in urine, but this is not clinically necessary since beeturia is a benign condition. A main concern in human medicine is that beeturia can be misdiagnosed as painless hematuria [15]. The occurrence of beeturia in urine of dogs and cats is not known.", "response": "Pink, red, or reddish-brown urine is most commonly due to intact red blood cells (hematuria), but it can also result from hemolyzed RBC/hemoglobin, muscle pigments (myoglobin), food pigments, porphyrins, or dyes. Intact RBC cause urine to range from pink to brown depending on RBC quantity, urine pH, and how long RBC have been in the urine; visible pink/red discoloration requires many RBC (in dogs, ~600 RBC/hpf for light pink and ~800–950 RBC/hpf for dark pink). With intact RBC, the red color clears after centrifugation or settling, whereas discoloration from dissolved hemoglobin, myoglobin, porphyrins, or dyes persists in the supernatant. Rarely, certain dry dog-food dyes or unusual foods can cause pink urine. In humans, beet ingestion can cause benign pink-to-deep-red urine (“beeturia,” scientifically “betacyanuria”) mainly from betanin/isobetanin; the urine may become pinker with sunlight exposure, HPLC can confirm pigments but is usually unnecessary, and the main clinical issue is confusion with painless hematuria. The occurrence of beeturia in dogs and cats is unknown."}
{"query": "Entrance of air into the pleural space causes intrapleural pressure to become positive, which results in collapse of the lungs with a subsequent drop in venous return and cardiac output. Pneumothorax can be closed or open depending on whether or not there is communication between the pleural space and outside the thorax. The most common causes of pneumothorax in dogs are likely blunt force trauma from car collisions or penetrating trauma from an inhaled foreign body. Exposure to porcupine quills has also resulted in pneumothorax in the northern United States and Canada (Sevy et al. 2023). In the cat, blunt trauma occurs from a car accident or fall from a height, although inflammatory lower airway disease is also a common cause of pneumothorax (Mooney et al. 2012). In dogs or cats, esophageal perforation can lead to pneumothorax, and it can also result from rupture of an emphysematous bulla, pleural bleb, neoplasm, Paragonimus cyst, or abscessed lung lobe. Lung necrosis due to embolization associated with heartworm disease or pulmonary thromboembolic disease has also been implicated in pneumothorax. Barotrauma during anesthesia or mechanical ventilation is recognized as an iatrogenic cause of pneumothorax and it can also occur post-­thoracocentesis or fine-­needle lung aspiration.

{"query": "Diagnosis of feline heartworm disease remains difficult. Peripheral eosinophilia is present in \\(<50\\%\\) of cases. Radiographic findings in feline heartworm disease are reflected by enlargement of caudal pulmonary lobar arteries to greater than 6 times the size of the ninth rib (Figure 8.5). However, in some cases pulmonary infiltrates can obscure visualization of the vasculature, and in one study of naturally infected cats, abnormalities in the pulmonary vasculature were uncommon (Venco et al. 2008). Unlike dogs, cardiac chambers are unlikely to be changed by heartworm infection. Focal or diffuse bronchointerstitial infiltrates are the most common parenchymal changes in cats with heartworm, but the presence and type of infiltrates depend on the stage of disease (Venco et al. 2008). Heartworm antibody positivity indicates only exposure to heartworm, and false-­ negative tests are unfortunately common. The antigen test can detect a single female heartworm, but can be falsely negative when no females are present or when only a few live males are present. Also, antigen–antibody complex formation appears to be more problematic in cats than in dogs, and heat-­treating serum leads to a substantial increase in positive antigen tests in infected cats (Little et al. 2014).

A 1:40 diluted 2% chlorhexidine solution should be used to cleanse the site instead. Venipuncture in salamanders is generally performed using the caudal tail vein. This is the same technique described previously for both lizards and snakes. It is important to remember that the vessel is very small and can collapse easily; therefore, do not place a large amount of negative pressure on the syringe during collection. A 25- to 27-gauge needle attached to a 1-mL syringe should be used. An insulin syringe can also be used for very small patients. The blood sample should be placed in a heparinized Microtainer tube for analysis. Venipuncture sites in frogs and toads include the femoral vein, ventral abdominal vein, and the lingual vein. The femoral and lingual veins are rarely used. The ventral abdominal vein is by far the easiest vessel to obtain a blood sample from. The frog or toad is gently positioned on its back with the restrainer holding the pectoral girdle. The person drawing blood can hold the pelvic girdle with one hand and draw blood with the other hand.

{"query": "‘Mouth rot’ is the colloquial term for stomatitis, commonly seen in many reptiles particularly in snakes and chelonians. The causes are many and varied. It can be caused by secondary infections with Gram-negative bacteria. The initial cause of the damage can be rubbing of the snout on vivarium glass, particularly in snakes. The use of opaque tape stuck to the outside of the glass helps the snake to ‘see it’, preventing this injury. Stomatitis may also be due to the overzealous force-feeding of anorectic reptiles or to other disease or stresses leading to reduced immune system function. Uric acid crystals deposited around the base of the teeth, due to visceral gout and renal failure, can allow infections to occur. Herpesvirus and ranavirus infections in terrestrial tortoises are also a cause, with oral ulceration and diphtherisis (see Figure 9). Mycoplasma spp. infections may also be associated with stomatitis in tortoises.

Enteritidis infect their healthy neighbors contributing to further economic loss. S. Enteritidis is one of the main foodborne pathogens responsible for spreading Salmonella in humans, representing a public health issue [3,4]. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics as growth promoters for weight gain in poultry contributed to the spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in humans and has prompted the prohibition of antibiotics in the poultry sector, so bacteriophages or phages (viruses that infect and lyse bacteria) have emerged as a strategy bio-control of Salmonella.

Regardless of the cause of the disease, it always shows a sequential pathogenesis. As many animals are likely to be affected, the clinician will see all the phases at one time. Initially there will be inflammation of the sclera, blepharospasm and an increase in lachrymation. This will lead to corneal inflammation and opacity. There may or may not be corneal vascularization. Lastly, there will be corneal ulceration. Treatment is with antibiotic eye ointment. It is important that corticosteroids are not instilled at the same time.

Based on genetic differences, NDV are currently classified in two major groups (class I and class II) (Czegledi et al., 2006), and the class II viruses have higher genetic and virulence variability and are known to infect a wide range of domestic and wild birds. They are divided into at least 18 genotypes (named I to XVIII), and vNDV belonging to multiple class II genotypes are identified in poultry outbreaks worldwide (Dimitrov et al., 2016). vNDV from different genotypes are often identified in wild birds, and the latter have been speculated to play a role in the spread of the virus (Snoeck et al., 2013). However, it is suggested that most of the wild bird isolations are a result of spillover of virus from infected poultry (Miller and Koch, 2013). Notably, there are two known exceptions where virulent viruses are endemic in wild birds. Birds of the family Columbidae are known to be a reservoir of the antigenic variants of vNDV, commonly referred to as pigeon paramyxoviruses 1 (PPMV-1). These pigeon-origin viruses are distributed worldwide, are commonly isolated from both wild and domestic pigeons, and are highly virulent for these species (Ujvari et al., 2003). The second group of viruses are endemic in some species of the genus Phalacrocorax (cormorant populations) in North America and are associated with periodic mortality events (Banerjee et al., 1994).

For this reason, the IFITM3 protein has a conserved sorting signal that is needed to enter the endosomal pathway. This signal peptide domain, referred to as Yxxφ, a tyrosine-based lysosomal targeting motif, is located in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the IFITM3 protein (Jia et al. 2014). This signal peptide is conserved in species including mammals and birds and is used as classification criteria between IFITM1 and IFITM3 proteins, because these two proteins share a highly similar protein sequence (Wang et al. 2017). Mutagenesis of the Yxxφ domain augmented mislocalization of the IFITM3 protein and reduced its antiviral capacity in mammals (Jia et al. 2012). However, in a recent study performed in ducks, the Yxxφ domain was not essential for correct localization of the IFITM3 protein and did not affect antiviral capacity (Blyth et al. 2015).

Myoglobin in urine largely stays in solution when exposed to 80% saturation of urine with ammonium sulfate, whereas hemoglobin is completely precipitated [16]. Although evaluation of serum color and use of ammonium sulfate precipitation testing can presumptively distinguish between hemoglobinuria and myoglobinuria, definitive differentiation requires urinary protein electrophoresis. Myoglobinuria probably occurs more commonly than diagnosed because it is easily confused with hemoglobinuria. Myoglobinuria sometimes is observed with exertional rhabdomyolysis in horses and dogs, and during postanesthetic rhabdomyolysis in horses [17–19]. Porphyrins in urine turn red after oxidation of porphobilinogen. This color intensifies upon standing and often is described as red or port wine [3]. The color of the urine supernatant does not change after centrifugation. In cats, porphyrinuria has been described as imparting an orange–brown color to urine that becomes orange–pink during fluorescence. Teeth of affected cats are also discolored with an orange–brown shade and undergo red fluorescence [20–23]. Intermittent porphyria and congenital erythropoietic porphyria have been described in cats [23]. Rabbits often can have red urine as a result of ingesting porphyrins in cabbage, carrots, dandelions, parsley or broccoli, and this red color can be a normal finding [24]. King George III of England (1738–1820) reportedly had urine that was blue as a consequence of hereditary intermittent porphyria [25].", "response": "Myoglobinuria and hemoglobinuria both cause red urine that does not clear with settling or centrifugation; the dipstick is positive for occult blood but no intact RBCs are seen in sediment. Both darken over time, with myoglobin more consistently becoming reddish-brown to brown. Hemoglobinuria can make serum pink due to hemoglobin–haptoglobin binding, whereas myoglobin has no carrier, does not discolor serum, and is rapidly cleared. An ammonium sulfate screen (80% saturation) differentiates them: myoglobin remains largely in solution while hemoglobin precipitates; definitive distinction requires urinary protein electrophoresis. Myoglobinuria is likely underdiagnosed and may occur with exertional rhabdomyolysis (horses, dogs) and postanesthetic rhabdomyolysis (horses).  \n\nPorphyrins can also redden urine after porphobilinogen oxidation; the red/“port wine” color intensifies on standing and remains after centrifugation. In cats, porphyrinuria may appear orange-brown and fluoresce orange-pink, with similarly discolored, red-fluorescing teeth; intermittent and congenital erythropoietic porphyria are reported. Rabbits may normally have red urine from dietary porphyrins (e.g., cabbage, carrots, dandelion, parsley, broccoli). King George III was reported to have blue urine associated with hereditary intermittent porphyria."}
{"query": "Biomechanical cervical spine models have been used extensively to evaluate feasibility and potential side effects of surgical procedures and instrumentation as it is currently not feasible to directly measure spinal loading in-vivo (Jaeger et al., 2011). Theoretical and numerical biomechanical models of the human cervical spine have been developed over the last three decades to investigate kinetics and kinematics of the neck (Dugailly et al., 2011). However, these models have not been translated to the canine cervical spine in spite of the high incidence of spinal disorders and injuries (Jeffery et al., 2013). Successful development and implementation of these models in canine spinal studies would require accurate anatomical data of the underlying soft tissues and bone (Sharir et al., 2006). Among the many components which should be incorporated into a model, muscles play a vital role in stability, loading and locomotion as they exert the majority of the required moments to maintain equilibrium in different postures and to perform various tasks (Nussbaum et al., 1995; Vasavada et al., 1998).

A recent publication has shown the consistent surface overexpression of IGF2R in human OS [27]. It was also previously found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) which alters methylation in an IGF2R CpG island was associated with an increased risk of OS development in humans [28]. Taken together, IGF2R expression appears to be both essential to and associated with the development of OS, making it an ideal therapeutic target.

The temperature at the hypothalamus is also a desired location to monitor, as this region is where body temperature is perceived (Cichocki et al., 2017). However, clinically, the most conventional method of taking a canine's temperature is through the rectal mucosa, as it continues to be a minimally invasive method that provides insight to core temperature (Kreissl and Neiger, 2015). Rectal thermometers have drawbacks, as they cannot be easily used on aggressive canids or ones with an infection or rupture of the anal mucosa (Kreissl and Neiger, 2015).

{"query": "Mitral valve competence requires complex interplay between structures that comprise the mitral apparatus – the mitral annulus, mitral valve leaflets, chordae tendineae, papillary muscles, and left atrial and left ventricular myocardium. Myxomatous mitral valve degeneration is prevalent in the canine, and most adult dogs develop some degree of mitral valve disease as they age, highlighting the apparent vulnerability of canine heart valves to injury. Myxomatous valvular remodeling is associated with characteristic histopathologic features. Changes include expansion of extracellular matrix with glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans; valvular interstitial cell alteration; and attenuation or loss of the collagen-laden fibrosa layer. These lead to malformation of the mitral apparatus, biomechanical dysfunction, and mitral incompetence. Mitral regurgitation is the most common manifestation of myxomatous valve disease and in advanced stages, associated volume overload promotes progressive valvular regurgitation, left atrial and left ventricular remodeling, atrial tears, chordal rupture, and congestive heart failure. Future studies are necessary to identify clinical-pathologic correlates that track disease severity and progression, detect valve dysfunction, and facilitate risk stratification.

{"query": "Canine atopic dermatitis is a complex disease that is often treated by multiple therapies either at the same time or over time. Most studies regarding efficacy are based on evaluating these drugs as sole therapy. Monotherapy is not frequently used in clinical practice because combination therapy is often necessary or more beneficial. The most common therapeutic interventions for CAD include the following: glucocorticoids, ciclosporin, antihistamines, essential fatty acids (EFAs) and allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT). Historically, glucocorticoids have been the most commonly prescribed medication for treatment of CAD, but even these are often used in conjunction with other therapies, such as bathing, antihistamines and fatty acids. Antihistamines have been described as having little benefit in managing atopic dermatitis;[3-5] however, antihistamines remain one of the most frequently used medications to treat the pruritus associated with CAD in dogs. Essential fatty acids, being commonly available and relatively inexpensive, are also frequently used in combination with other therapies. The slow onset of improvement with ASIT in dogs frequently results in the concurrent use of other therapies, at least during the first few months of therapy. Intermittent antimicrobial therapy is often necessary to eliminate complicating secondary infections. The most recent recommendation of the International Task Force on Canine Atopic Dermatitis focuses on this concept of a multimodal treatment approach.[4] A multimodal treatment approach will provide increased benefit to the dog by intervening at several different points along the pathway from exposure to an offending antigen to development of clinical signs (pruritus, superficial pyoderma and otitis externa).", "response": "Canine atopic dermatitis (CAD) is a complex condition typically managed with multiple therapies used concurrently or sequentially, although most efficacy studies evaluate drugs as monotherapy, which is uncommon in practice.

Due to thousands of years of contact with humans and domestication, canines and humans have a unique relationship sharing social cues, dietary and other environmental stimuli (Hoffman et al., 2018). Canine models also provide a useful evolutionary intermediate model to that of rodents featuring a gyrencephalic brain and convergent sociocognitive skills with humans (Berns et al., 2012; Thompkins et al., 2016). Though research into differences in longevity among canines is still ongoing, selective breeding and diverse features within the canine population have potential for classifying specific neuropathology phenotypes (Kaeberlein et al., 2016; Urfer et al., 2019). In addition, studies have found the aging canine brain exhibits cortical atrophy (Tapp et al., 2006), accumulates beta-amyloid with age (Kumar et al., 2018), and can develop progressive cognitive decline with memory dysfunctions as seen in Alzheimer's disease (Prpar Mihevc and Majdic, 2019).

An estimated  $60\\%$  of older dogs ( $>8$  years old) are affected by canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) (Fast et al., 2013) which is defined by a decline in cognitive function accompanied by cerebral degeneration and decreases in cortical volume (Kimotsuki et al., 2005), similar to that observed in mild cognitive impairment as related to early Alzheimer's disease in humans (Schütt et al., 2016). For these reasons, canines are the subject of increasing research as a naturally occurring model of human aging.", "response": "Aging dogs develop naturally occurring brain pathologies similar to aging humans—including beta-amyloid plaques and tauopathy—unlike common rodent models. Because of long domestication and close contact with humans, dogs share social cues and environmental influences with people, and they offer an intermediate translational model with a gyrencephalic brain and convergent sociocognitive skills. Selective breeding and diversity within dog populations may help classify specific neuropathology phenotypes. Studies show aging canine brains exhibit cortical atrophy, increasing beta-amyloid accumulation with age, and progressive cognitive decline with memory dysfunction resembling Alzheimer’s disease; many dogs also show age-related declines in memory, mood, and processing speed. About 60% of dogs older than 8 years are estimated to have canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD), characterized by cognitive decline with cerebral degeneration and reduced cortical volume, paralleling mild cognitive impairment/early Alzheimer’s in humans. Consequently, dogs are increasingly researched as a naturally occurring model of human aging."}

Complete regeneration would require production of new neurons and glia with successful reinnervation of the correct targets in order to restore function. There is still no therapy tailored to this complex scenario. The discovery of resident stem cells within the nervous system has created the promise of new therapies [13]. Strategically, stem cells can advance current techniques based on combined points of action: activation of resident neural stem cells from their dormant state, their differentiation into relevant cell types (neurons, glial cells), regulation of scar formation, prevention of cyst formation, and secretion of neurotrophic and other factors to promote matrix repair and regeneration [14, 15]. For example, mesenchymal stromal cells and neural crest stem cells modulate oxidative stress, and secrete cytokines and growth factors that have immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, pro-angiogenic and anti-apoptotic effects [16, 17].

{"query": "D. immitis is one of several species of parasitic nematode that house the obligate symbiont bacteria Wolbachia pipientis (Bandi et al. 2001). Large colonies of Wolbachia reside in the subdermal lateral cords of both male and female nematodes, as well as in the reproductive structures of females (Slatko et al. 2010). Within the past decade, scientists demonstrated the obligate nature of this symbiosis by treating pathogenic nematodes with antibiotics, which quickly curtailed embryogenesis, progression of larval stages, and growth of adult worms (Slatko et al. 2010). It is now widely accepted by those within the field of heartworm research that the presence of W. pipientis within the bodies of adult worms is vital to survival and reproduction. Evidence towards the intense coevolution of this symbiosis can be found in the phylogenetic connections among many worms that contain Wolbachia, as well as the existence of Wolbachia within the common bedbug, among other insect species (Bandi et al. 2001; Slatko et al. 2010). The fact that Wolbachia surface protein (WSP) illicits a damaging humoral response from canine tissue in D. immitis infections suggests that D. immitis selection for storage of Wolbachia combats the typical parasite attenuation strategy within the host. Therefore, current studies aim to develop treatment implementing both antibiotics and macrocyclic lactones (Ivermectin).", "response": "Dirofilaria immitis harbors the obligate symbiont bacterium Wolbachia pipientis, which forms large colonies in the nematode’s subdermal lateral cords (males and females) and in female reproductive tissues. Antibiotic treatment of these nematodes rapidly suppresses embryogenesis, larval development, and adult worm growth, demonstrating that Wolbachia is essential for adult worm survival and reproduction. Evidence of strong coevolution includes phylogenetic patterns among Wolbachia-containing worms and Wolbachia’s presence in insects such as bedbugs. Because Wolbachia surface protein can trigger a damaging humoral response in canine tissue during D. immitis infection—suggesting the parasite maintains Wolbachia despite typical host-related attenuation pressures—current studies are exploring combined therapy using antibiotics plus macrocyclic lactones (e.g., ivermectin)."}

{"query": "Histotripsy, an experimental noninvasive extracorporeal focused ultrasound technology, has been explored as a less invasive approach to surgical management of BPH, demonstrating the ability to homogenize prostate tissue in an in vivo canine model with resultant tissue debulking. Histotripsy involves delivery of high amplitude, short (<50 μs) pulses of ultrasound energy at a low duty cycle (<1%) to a cigar shaped geometric focal volume. The resulting compression and rarefaction causes the development of microbubbles that oscillate, coalesce, and collapse producing mechanical fractionation of targeted tissues at the cellular level, reducing tissue architecture and cellular structures to a fine slurry of acellular debris. Volumetric ablation is accomplished by passing the transducer focal volume through the targeted region. As targeted tissue is homogenized, the US appearance becomes progressively hypoechoic.

Slopes as high as 3.4, with a mode between 1.5-2.0, occur in traits associated with sexual display (e.g. antler size in the giant deer Megaloceros), possibly for reasons such as the \"handicap principle\" [12,13,19,20] whereby traits that are supposedly disadvantageous, and therefore costly to maintain, advertise for 'better' quality of individuals that can maintain them.

{"query": "The respiratory tract is in close and continuous contact with the outer environment. Through the gaseous exchange, myriads of airborne pathogens directly get in touch with the respiratory epithelium [1]. To prevent these organisms from causing insults, the respiratory epithelium provides a physicochemical barrier and builds, together with the innate immune system, the first line of defense [2]. In order to study host-pathogen interactions in the respiratory tract, it is essential to gain comprehensive knowledge about the characteristic cellular structure and the complexity of the respiratory tract epithelium. The latter consists of a diverse range of cell types, including basal cells, ciliated cells, brush cells, goblet cells, club cells, neuroendocrine cells, ionocytes and Hillock cells, which vary in concentration throughout the respiratory tract and form a pseudostratified, columnar epithelium [3-5]. Tight junctions are intercellular, junctional complexes expressed on the apical side of epithelial cells to maintain the integrity of the airway epithelium, which is necessary for an impermeable barrier function [6]. This physical barrier is enhanced by the mucociliary escalator, which clears the conducting airways by entrapping inhaled particles in mucus derived from secretory cells and propelling the mucus by coordinated ciliary movement anteriorly towards the pharynx [7]. In response to epithelial injury, a subset of basal cells demonstrates the capability of self-renewal and differentiation into ciliated and secretory cells for orderly regeneration and preservation of the protective barrier [8].", "response": "The respiratory tract is continuously exposed to airborne pathogens, which contact the respiratory epithelium during gas exchange.

{"query": "Amidst the overarching resemblance in mammary gland morphology and activity, a notable discrepancy in mammary predisposition to tumorigenesis emerges within various members of the mammalian class, suggesting differences in the stringency of controlling normal development and homeostasis. This discrepancy can be broadly categorized according to dietary preference: mammals belonging to the carnivore/omnivore taxa are susceptible to breast cancer, whereas herbivores are much less exposed (reviewed in [18, 19]). For example, mammary tumors are the most common neoplasm in female dogs, with up to  $50\\%$  being malignant [20]. In cats, mammary tumors account for about  $17\\%$  of all neoplasms, with  $80 - 90\\%$  being malignant [21]. Wild carnivores, such as jungle cats, jaguars, leopards, lions, and tigers also develop mammary tumors, which exhibit morphological patterns similar to those in human breast cancer [19]. In contrast, mammary tumors have rarely been reported in domestic mares [22, 23], cows (Table 1), ewes [24], goats, or sows [25]. Mammary cancer is also rare in zoo and freeranging ungulates [26-28]. These significant differences in mammary gland tumor development may have contributed to the generally lower mortality rates observed in clovenhooved domestic or zoo mammals—compared to carnivores [29]. Pigs are cloven-hoofed animals and omnivores, capable of consuming both plant and animal matter. Notably, there are significant morphological similarities between their mammary glands and the human breast. A review of the literature by Morey-Matamalas and colleagues [30] highlights that naturally occurring mammary tumors are rare in pigs. However, porcine epithelial cells have been shown to develop neoplasia following oncogenic transformation and subsequent injection into mouse mammary glands [31]. This observation emphasizes the critical influence of the host environment on tumorigenesis and suggests that pigs may occupy an intermediate position between carnivores and herbivores in their susceptibility to mammary cancer.", "response": "Mammals show broadly similar mammary gland structure and function, but differ markedly in susceptibility to mammary tumorigenesis, implying differences in how strictly development and homeostasis are controlled. This variation correlates with diet: carnivores/omnivores are generally prone to breast cancer, while herbivores are much less affected. Mammary tumors are common in female dogs (up to 50% malignant) and occur frequently in cats (about 17% of neoplasms, 80–90% malignant), and they are also seen in wild carnivores (e.g., jungle cats, jaguars, leopards, lions, tigers) with patterns resembling human breast cancer. In contrast, mammary tumors are rarely reported in herbivorous domestic animals (mares, cows, ewes, goats, sows) and are rare in zoo/free-ranging ungulates; this may contribute to lower mortality in cloven-hoofed domestic or zoo mammals compared with carnivores. Pigs, though cloven-hoofed omnivores with mammary glands similar to humans, rarely develop mammary tumors naturally, yet porcine epithelial cells can become neoplastic after oncogenic transformation and form tumors when injected into mouse mammary glands, highlighting the importance of the host environment and suggesting pigs may have intermediate susceptibility between carnivores and herbivores."}

Accordingly, MSCs have been used in human therapies for conditions such as xenograft rejection and graft vs. host disease [3,4]. Furthermore, in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD), MSCs ameliorate renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate [5]. Cats exhibit several inflammatory diseases. In particular, many elderly cats experience significant CKD-related problems [6]. On the other hand, feline MSCs (fMSCs) do not have a considerable effect on this disease [7]. In addition to the pathological conditions that depend on the species, the unsuccessful results in cats may be due to the lower biological activity of fMSC, the earlier loss of proliferative activity and stemness [8], and the poorer ability to produce bioactive mediators without stimulation [9].", "response": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have anti-inflammatory, tissue-protective, and anti-fibrotic effects mediated by secreted factors such as IDO, PGE2, HGF, and TSG-6, and have been used clinically for conditions like xenograft rejection and graft-versus-host disease.

{"query": "Sperm cryopreservation allows for a long-term preservation of genetic materials facilitating offspring propagation using assisted reproductive technologies, that is artificial insemination (AI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), embryo transfer (ET) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). However, changes in temperature during freezing and thawing injure sperm cells. Feline sperm cells are collected routinely from live animals by electroejaculation, artificial vagina or urethral catheterization (Zambelli & Cunto, 2006). Sperm cells can similarly be collected from epididymis and testis after castration or necropsy offering an alternative source of genetic material particularly important for endangered species of wild felids. As ICSI technique has demonstrated to be highly efficient in felids, the mission of the sperm cells is now only to carry intact DNA to the oocytes and other components of male fertility have significantly lower importance. Therefore, the evaluation of DNA integrity, for long neglected in this species, is nowadays significantly highlighted in addition to semen other basic traits, that is motility, morphology and acrosome and membrane integrity. Sperm DNA assessment is considered as a significant indicator to predict fertilization rates, embryo development competence and pregnancy outcomes (Tesarik et al., 2004). As sperm DNA damage is often the result of oxidative stress in the male reproductive tract, the potential contribution of antioxidative agent supplementation to sperm cryopreservation media has been widely evaluated in both domestic (Thuwanut et al., 2008; Thuwanut et al., 2010) and wild cats (Thuwanut et al., 2011).", "response": "Sperm cryopreservation enables long-term preservation of genetic material for assisted reproduction (AI, IVF, ET, ICSI), but freezing and thawing can damage sperm cells.

Because ICSI is highly efficient in felids, sperm’s main role is to deliver intact DNA, making DNA integrity assessment increasingly important alongside standard semen traits (motility, morphology, acrosome, and membrane integrity).

{"query": "During the last decade the availability of molecular techniques to detect provirus (DNA) and free plasma virus (RNA) has enhanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of FeLV infection. It has become apparent that antigen detection is a relatively insensitive indicator of infection and that cats previously considered to have recovered using conventional techniques can harbour low levels of virus. Following experimental exposure most cats show evidence of persistent, transcriptionally active virus.[10-15] In the field, up to  $10\\%$  of antigen-negative cats test positive for provirus in peripheral blood by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).[10,16-18] The absence of viral RNA in the saliva of  $96\\%$  of provirus-positive/antigen-negative cats, the success of test-and-removal programs that relied on antigen detection to identify 'infection' cats and the results of attempted experimental  transmission from latently infected cats,[4,17,19] suggest that regressive infection, characterised by absent antigenaemia and low, transient proviral load,[15] does not play a major role in natural transmission. The potential of FeLV to contribute to disease in antigen-negative cats requires clarification. While some epidemiological data demonstrate an increased risk of lymphoma and reduced survival in FeLV-exposed, antigen-negative cats compared with cats never exposed to the virus,[5,20,21] the results of immunohistochemical and molecular studies to date have yielded conflicting results.[22-28]", "response": "Molecular methods detecting FeLV proviral DNA and plasma viral RNA have improved understanding of FeLV pathogenesis, showing that antigen tests are relatively insensitive and that some cats thought recovered can harbor low-level virus.

{"query": "The silver homolog premelanosome protein (PMEL, alternative names: Pmel-17, SILV, gp100 and ME20) has an important function in pigmentation of vertebrates. It is known that the protein is responsible for fibril formation within eumelanosomes [1], and it determines the elliptical eumelanosomal shape [2]. In contrast, pheomelanosomes show no fibril formation presumably due to the lack of PMEL expression [3]. The fibrillary structures laterally assemble into sheets, which serve as a matrix for eumelanin deposition (reviewed by Watt and co-workers [4]). Mutations in the PMEL gene are associated with coat color dilution in the mouse [5], chicken [6], dog [7] and horse [8]. In cattle, PMEL function seems to be unique because effects of genetic variants are not restricted to eumelanic coat color dilution as reported for other vertebrates. The non-synonymous mutation  $PMELc.64G > A$  (NM_001080215.2) in the signal peptide region of the bovine PMEL protein (NP_001073684) is causative for the Dilution locus (https://omia.org/OMIA001545/9913/), associated with extreme coat color dilution in the Charolais cattle breed [9]. A three-base-pair deletion c.50_52delTTC also in the N-terminal region of the bovine PMEL protein is responsible for coat color dilution in Highland and Galloway breeds [10]. These mutations in the bovine PMEL gene affect eumelanic as well as pheomelanic pigmentation [9-11]. This is remarkable because in other species pheomelanosomes are assumed to lack PMEL expression [3]. Furthermore, the PMEL locus has been identified as one component of a complex interaction of three loci underlying the genetic defect \"rat tail syndrome\" (RTS) in cattle (https://omia.org/OMIA001544/9913/) [12]. RTS is exclusively expressed in animals with a eumelanic background. This genetic defect was observed in calves produced by crossing animals from German Holstein with animals from the Charolais breed. The calves have short, curly, sometimes sparse hair, and a lack of normal tail hair development. Besides substantial effects on the hair structure, this defect is also associated with genetically-determined variation in coat color; animals with the RTS phenotype exhibit a darker grey (charcoal) coat color than animals without RTS phenotype.", "response": "The silver homolog premelanosome protein (PMEL; also called Pmel-17, SILV, gp100, ME20) is important for vertebrate pigmentation by forming fibrils in eumelanosomes, helping determine their elliptical shape; these fibrils assemble into sheets that act as a matrix for eumelanin deposition. Pheomelanosomes are described as lacking such fibrils, presumably because PMEL is not expressed. PMEL mutations are linked to coat color dilution in several species (mouse, chicken, dog, horse). In cattle, PMEL variants have broader effects than typical eumelanic-only dilution: the non-synonymous mutation **PMEL c.64G>A** (signal peptide region) causes the Charolais **Dilution** locus with extreme coat color dilution, and the **c.50_52delTTC** deletion (N-terminal region) causes dilution in Highland and Galloway; notably, these bovine mutations affect both eumelanic and pheomelanic pigmentation. PMEL is also one of three interacting loci involved in cattle **rat tail syndrome (RTS)**, which appears only on a eumelanic background and was observed in German Holstein × Charolais crosses, producing calves with short, curly/sometimes sparse hair, abnormal tail hair development, and a darker grey (“charcoal”) coat color compared with non-RTS animals."}

This facilitates angiogenesis and proliferation, allowing for malignant transformation and rapid somatic evolution (1-3).

{"query": "Bovines have long-been recognized as a key contributor to human schistosomiasis in Asia (Gray et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2006), and emerging evidence suggests they may be contributing to human schistosomiasis in Africa (Colley and Loker, 2018). Schistosomiasis is among the most burdensome helminth infections worldwide, with transmission being reported in a total of 78 countries in 2018 and approximately 230 million people in need of preventative treatment (World Health Organization, 2020). Although great strides have been made in the last few decades in global schistosomiasis control (World Health Organization, 2020), pockets of reemergent or persistent transmission highlight the need for careful consideration of possible local drivers of transmission (Kittur et al., 2019; Song et al., 2016). A poignant example is found in Schistosoma japonicum transmission in China, where despite well-established control programs and considerable progress towards elimination since the mid-1950s (Xu et al., 2016), a national report highlighted that there remained 450 endemic counties in 2020, a quarter of which had not achieved elimination criteria by year's end (Zhang et al., 2021). S. japonicum is transmitted by at least 40 species of wild and domestic mammals (Gray et al., 2009b), and animal activities near likely transmission sites may be important sources of reemergence and persistence. Although there are several domesticated and wild animals that can carry and transmit S. japonicum, (Li et al., 2015; Van Dorssen et al., 2017), estimates from Eastern China suggest that bovines may be responsible for as much as  $75\\%$  of human transmission (Guo et al., 2006). This substantial contribution is thought to be related to the high degree of environmental overlap between humans and bovines during agricultural production, as well as the large amount of fecal output of bovines, which is estimated to be as high as 100 times that of human fecal production each day (Gray et al., 2009b; He et al., 2001; Ross et al., 2001). Additionally, the high frequency of livestock movement via the livestock trade within mountainous regions of China may facilitate the spread of S. japonicum infections across the region (Zheng et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2012).", "response": "Bovines are a major contributor to human schistosomiasis in Asia and may also contribute in Africa. Schistosomiasis is a highly burdensome helminth infection, reported in 78 countries (2018) with about 230 million people needing preventive treatment. Despite major global control progress, persistent or reemergent transmission indicates local drivers must be considered. In China, although S. japonicum control has operated since the mid-1950s with substantial progress, 450 counties were still endemic in 2020 and about one quarter had not met elimination criteria by year’s end. S. japonicum can be transmitted by at least 40 wild and domestic mammal species, and animal activity near transmission sites may sustain transmission. In Eastern China, bovines may account for up to 75% of human transmission, likely due to close human–bovine overlap in agriculture and bovines’ very high fecal output (up to ~100× that of humans daily). Frequent livestock trade and movement in mountainous regions may further spread S. japonicum."}
{"query": "Gammaherpesviruses (GHVs) are double-stranded DNA viruses. They belong to the Herpesviridae family, which includes three subfamilies: Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaherpesvirinae [1,2]. GHVs can infect humans, establishing a lifelong persistent infection mostly without evident clinical signs [3]. Host immunity is supposed to eliminate the infection, but frequently the virus undergoes latency with potential reactivation. GHV reactivation is suspected during co-infections or when cell-mediated immunity is compromised. In the latter cases, the virus can cause severe diseases that can be potentially fatal [4,5]. Two human GHVs are known to promote tumorigenesis in humans: Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [6-9]. Epstein-Barr virus is commonly identified in adult human beings worldwide. The virus is normally innocuous; however, in a few cases, it can cause lymphomas, carcinomas or other types of cancer.

{"query": "Radioresistance and radiotoxicity have been reported following cancer treatments in felines. Optimizing radiation doses to induce cytotoxic effects to only cancer cells and not normal cells is critical in achieving effective radiation therapy; however, the mechanisms of radiation resistance, radiotoxicity, and DNA damage response (DDR) in feline cells have not yet been elucidated. A DNA double-strand break (DSB) is the most toxic type of DNA damage induced by X-rays and heavy ion beams used in treating cancers. Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells is one of the most widely used cat cells in life science research. Here, we report that DSB-triggered senescence induced by X-rays is important in inhibiting the proliferation of CRFK cells. We demonstrated through cell proliferation assay that X-rays at doses 2 Gy and 10 Gy are toxic to CRFK cells that irradiating CRFK cells inhibits their proliferation. In X-irradiated CRFK cells, a dose-dependent increase in DSB-triggered senescence was detected according to morphological changes and using senescence-associated  $\\beta$  galactosidase staining assay. Moreover, our data indicated that in CRFK cells, the major DDR pathway, which involves the phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser139, was normally activated by ATM kinases.

X-ray doses of 2 Gy and 10 Gy were shown (via cell proliferation assays) to be toxic and to inhibit CRFK cell proliferation. Irradiated cells displayed a dose-dependent increase in DSB-triggered senescence, supported by morphological changes and senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining. The major DDR pathway in CRFK cells was normally activated, involving ATM kinase–dependent phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser139.

{"query": "Feline leukemia is considered to be a severe disease that can progress to a fatal illness faster than FIV infection [4]. FeLV infection results in several different disease outcomes (reviewed in [5]). An unknown percentage of infected cats can control the infection in the initial stages and avoid the virus from spreading to target tissues (\"abortive infection\"). Many cats develop a \"regressive infection\", in which the immune response partially contains the virus and viremia persists only for a few weeks. In some of these cats, the viremia is longer, and the virus infects haemopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, where it can remain latent as proviral DNA integrated in the cellular genome. In approximately one third of all infected cats, the early immune response is unable to block the virus, and a massive replication and spread of the virus is produced, including the infection of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow; this condition is called \"progressive infection\", and cats become persistently viremic. Eventually the infection progresses to the development of related neoplastic (such as leukemia and lymphoma) and non-neoplastic (such as anemia, gingivostomatitis, and enteritis) diseases [4,6].

{"query": "Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is a systemic fatal disease affecting mostly young cats (Pedersen, 2014a) sustained by the feline coronavirus (FCoV), which commonly occurs in multicat environments. The FCoVs usually inhabit the intestinal tract (feline enteric coronavirus, FECV). During viral replication within the enterocyte, a mutated variant, also called FIP virus (FIPV) may be generated (Pedersen, 2014a). Whichever is the exact mutation, FIPV loses tropism for enterocytes and gains the capability to replicate inside macrophages (Kipar et al., 2010). Moreover, FCoV induces macrophage-monocyte proliferation in haemo-lymphatic tissues and thus allow a progressive viral adaptation to the replication within these cells (Kipar and Meli, 2014). Although both viral biotypes (FECV and FIPV) can spread systemically, only the FIPV may induce FIP, due to the higher rate of interactions between the virus and monocytes. Moreover, the host immune response has a pivotal role in the development of the disease. Indeed, the cell-mediated immunity seems to be protective. On the other hand, it is known that the humoral response induces development of antibodies that enhance the in vitro virus uptake in macrophages and this, in turn, contributes in vivo to the development of the clinical signs seen during the effusive (wet) form of the disease. The non-effusive (dry) form is considered as an intermediate status involving a partially effective cellular response (Pedersen, 2014a).", "response": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a systemic, fatal disease mainly affecting young cats and is caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV), which is common in multi-cat environments.

Although both FECV and FIPV can spread systemically, only FIPV leads to FIP, linked to increased virus–monocyte interactions.

However, these viruses can also cause a life-threatening systemic illness with a high fatality rate in cats. FCoV associated with a fatal disease in cats, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), causes systemic pyogranulomatous inflammation in various organs, which subsequently progresses to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity and death. In contrast to the more common asymptomatic or mild enteritis caused by feline enteric coronavirus, the enteric biotype of FCoV, FIP is relatively uncommon in the general cat population, but it is the leading cause of death in young cats (1-3). In addition to the two biotypes of feline enteric coronavirus and FIP coronavirus, FCoVs are also classified into two serotypes, I and II. FCoV serotype I is more prevalent than serotype II, which appears to be derived from recombination with canine coronavirus in the spike (S) protein (4-8).

Cats (Felis catus) express three types of A3s: single-domain A3Z2, single-domain A3Z3, and double-domain A3Z2Z3. We proposed that FIV Vif would selectively interact with the Z2 and the Z3 A3s. Indeed, we identified two N-terminal Vif motifs (12LF13 and 18GG19) that specifically interacted with the FcaA3Z2 protein but not with A3Z3. In contrast, the exclusive degradation of FcaA3Z3 was regulated by a region of three residues (M24, L25, and I27). Only a FIV Vif carrying a combination of mutations from both interaction sites lost the capacity to degrade and counteract FcaA3Z2Z3. However, alterations in the specific A3s interaction sites did not affect the cellular localization of the FIV Vif protein and binding to feline A3s. Pulldown experiments demonstrated that the A3 binding region localized to FIV Vif residues 50 to 80, outside the specific A3 interaction domain. Finally, we found that the Vif sites specific to individual A3s are conserved in several FIV lineages of domestic cat and nondomestic cats, while being absent in the FIV Vif of pumas.

FeLV-C, FeLV-T, and FeLV-TG35 contain focal insertions/substitutions/deletions relative to FeLV-A in different regions: FeLV-C is uncommon, results from de novo env mutations, and is associated with aplastic anaemia. FeLV-D was identified alongside a newly discovered domestic cat endogenous retrovirus (ERV-DC) distinct from classic endogenous FeLV. FeLV-T is uniquely T-lymphocyte–tropic, is strongly cytopathic (unlike other subgroups that bud without cytopathicity), and requires two host T-cell proteins for efficient replication. FeLV-TG35-2 uses a different receptor and may represent a new subgroup."}

Studies have also demonstrated FCV infection in dogs (Martella et al. 2002), which suggests a potential risk for cross-species transmission. FCV strains differ in tropism and virulence; therefore, infection presents with a wide range of clinical signs. Most strains induce a fairly characteristic, mild syndrome characterized by pyrexia, oral ulceration, and mild respiratory and conjunctival signs. However, some FCV strains are nonpathogenic, and others are more virulent than the most common strains, with the ability to induce more severe systemic disease.

The early terminology of vertebrate brain segments suggested that the entire avian telencephalon consisted solely of greatly enlarged basal ganglia, thus completely lacking the equivalents to the neocortical structures of mammals that would allow for complex cognition to emerge (Reiner et al. 2004a; Jarvis et al. 2005).", "response": "Parrots and other birds have long been valued as pets for their ability to imitate and form attachments to humans, but the scientific community historically viewed them as incapable of complex cognition.

A typical cat has a long and fat tail, a long trunk, shorter-than-typical legs, and its color ranges from chestnut brown to cream with faint brown spots [2]. It only inhabits Tsushima Island in the Nagasaki Prefecture [3]. The TLC tends to be abundant in the upper region of Tsushima, known as Kamijima. Approximately 200 to 300 TLCs lived on Tsushima Island until the 1970s [4].

Human activity in wildcat habitats is one of the biggest threats to their survival [5]. Another important factor is infectious diseases. Disease transmission between domestic cats and TLCs have been previously documented [4,6-8]. Several cases of TLCs being infected with diseases commonly associated with domestic cats, including the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and Felis catus gammaderpesvirus1 (FcaGHV1), have been reported [3,4,6]. According to a study that utilized the Geographical Information System (GIS) data, FIV infection risk in TLCs is higher in areas densely populated with domestic cats than in areas sparsely populated with the species [1]. A previous study reported the prevalence of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection in domestic cats but not in TLCs; however, it was demonstrated that the virus could replicate in their cells [3]. A study reported the detection of the feline foamy virus (FFV) infection in Iriomote leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis) in Japan [9]. A single FFV infection has been shown to be associated with potential pathological changes in domestic cats [10]. A previous study reported histopathological changes in the kidney and lung after experimental FFV inoculation [11].

{"query": "The cerebral cortex receives thousands of inputs from the sensory organs and uses them to create representations of the world and respond appropriately. With the exception of smells, all sensory signals travel through a part of the brain called the thalamus on their way to the cortex. The principal cells of the thalamus then relay this constant stream of information to the cerebral cortex in an orderly, topographical manner. When a neuron in the thalamus relays a signal to a neuron in the input layer of the cortex, the cortical neuron receiving the input can be excitatory or inhibitory, changing the nature of the signal. Figuring out the rules that govern the connections between the thalamus and the cortex is fundamental to understanding the transformation of sensory inputs that travel through this route. For example, how is it that activity of the whole visual cortex is driven by input from the thalamus when fewer than  $1 - 5\\%$  of the synapses into the primary visual cortex originate in the thalamus (Douglas and Martin, 2004; Markov et al., 2011)?

Understanding the rules of thalamocortical connectivity is essential for explaining how sensory inputs are transformed—especially given that in primary visual cortex only about 1–5% of synapses originate from the thalamus, yet thalamic input can drive activity across the entire visual cortex, implying thalamocortical synapses must act cooperatively."}

{"query": "Atherosclerosis, as the most common underlying cause of cardiovascular disease, is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in many populations [1,2]. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory process involving multiple cell types and cytokines [3].

As the plaque progression continues, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) migrate into the intima and elaborate extracellular matrix. After decades, the fatty streak could progress into fibroatheroma lesions, characterized by the fibrous caps encompassing the lipid core [5]. At advanced stages, stable lesions have a small lipid core and a thick fibrous cap, while vulnerable lesions have the relatively thin fibrous cap and large lipid core. Once the fibrous cap rupture, a superimposed thrombosis could occlude the arterial lumens and disrupt blood flow, which is responsible for most morbidity and mortality of atherosclerosis.

{"query": "Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (soluble) (PCK1) is a gluconeogenic gene that encodes the rate-limited enzyme PEPCK-C in gluconeogenesis (Hanson & Patel 1994). The role of  $PCK1$  in gluconeogenesis has been extensively reviewed (Hanson & Patel 1994), and it is well recognized that  $PCK1$  expression regulates plasma glucose level. For example, changing  $PCK1$  expression in the liver induces increased blood glucose (Valera et al. 1994) or hypoglycemia (Vidnes & Sovik 1976; She et al. 2000). Although  $PCK1$  has been linked to primarily gluconeogenesis, it has also been found in tissues that don't produce glucose, such as adipose tissue (Hanson & Reshef 2003; Reshef et al. 2003; Qu et al. 2016). Therefore, in addition to gluconeogenesis, other functions have been proposed for  $PCK1$ . Studies of the glyceroneogenesis have provided insight on the important role of  $PCK1$  in lipid metabolism. Glyceroneogenesis, which de novo synthesizes glycerol-3-phosphate from non-glucose or non-glycerol precursors, is a critical pathway for re-esterifying the free fatty acids released by adipose tissues during fasting conditions (Vaughan 1962; Ballard et al. 1967; Gorin et al. 1969).  $PCK1$  has been demonstrated to play important roles in this process. For example, She et al. (2000) found that mice with the deletion of  $PCK1$  in the liver presented a fatty liver because of the accumulation of fatty acid. Moreover, Olswang et al. (2002) reported that the deletion of  $PCK1$  expression in adipose tissue inhibited glyceroneogenesis and reduced triglyceride deposition.

Evidence from glyceroneogenesis—a pathway that synthesizes glycerol-3-phosphate from non-glucose/non-glycerol precursors to enable re-esterification of free fatty acids during fasting—shows PCK1 is important in lipid metabolism: liver-specific PCK1 deletion in mice causes fatty liver due to fatty acid accumulation, and adipose PCK1 deletion inhibits glyceroneogenesis and reduces triglyceride deposition.

Humans express sialic acid  $\\alpha$ -2,6 linked galactose (SA  $\\alpha$ -2,6-Gal) surface molecules on epithelial cells in the upper airways, which is the site of replication for IAV in humans (Baum and Paulson, 1990; Couceiro et al., 1993). As such, strains of IAV that infect humans replicate in the upper airways. Birds, however, predominantly express SA  $\\alpha$ -2,3-Gal in their digestive tracts and lungs (Costa et al., 2012). Strains of IAV which are adapted to replicate in birds preferentially bind these receptors over human SA  $\\alpha$ -2,6-Gal receptors. Chickens also express  $\\alpha$ -2,6-Gal in their intestinal tracts and lungs, whereas ducks only express these receptors in their lungs. Chickens also have a predominance of SA  $\\alpha$ -2,6-Gal in their trachea whereas ducks have SA  $\\alpha$ -2,3-Gal receptor dominance (Kuchipudi et al., 2009). As IAV has been known to jump host species, as is the case of avian IAV jumping to humans, this suggests that chickens may be responsible for propagating avian strains of influenza that can then infect humans. IAV can use other receptors such as phosphoglycans on host cells to gain entry and seems to depend on more than just SA linkages to enter cells (Byrd-Leotis et al., 2019).", "response": "Influenza A virus (IAV) tissue and host specificity are strongly influenced by hemagglutinin (HA) binding to sialic acid (SA) receptors on host cell glycoproteins, with different terminal SA linkages supporting infection in different species and tissues. Humans mainly express SAα2,6-Gal in upper-airway epithelial cells, so human-adapted IAV strains replicate primarily in the upper airways. Birds predominantly express SAα2,3-Gal in the digestive tract and lungs, so avian-adapted IAV preferentially binds these receptors rather than human-type SAα2,6-Gal. Chickens and ducks differ: chickens express SAα2,6-Gal in intestines and lungs and have SAα2,6-Gal dominance in the trachea, while ducks express SAα2,6-Gal only in lungs and show SAα2,3-Gal dominance in the trachea. Because IAV can jump species (e.g., avian to human), chickens may help propagate avian strains with potential to infect humans. IAV can also use other receptors (e.g., phosphoglycans), indicating cell entry depends on more than SA linkages alone."}
{"query": "Stimulator of the IFN gene (STING) is a newly discovered key type I IFN positive regulatory factor and is also known as MPYS, mediator of IRF-3 activation (MITA), endoplasmic reticulum IFN stimulator (ERIS) or transmembrane protein 173 (TMEM173) [4-6]. STING is a membrane-related protein that contains four or five transmembrane regions, which are mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and partially located in mitochondria and mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) [4-7]. When STING is overexpressed in cells, IRF3 is activated and viral replication is suppressed [4,5]. RNA interference assays demonstrate that by reducing the expression of STING, the activation of IRF3 is inhibited and viral replication increases [4,5]. Bacteria and DNA viruses activate STING, but recent studies show that STING also plays an important role in inhibiting positive strand RNA viral replication [8-10]. STING functions downstream of RIG-I and MAVS and upstream of TBK1 and is considered a scaffold protein for the MAVS/tank binding kinase 1 (TBK1)/IRF3 complex when an RNA virus is infected and is capable of binding to RIG-I (rather than MDA5), MAVS, TBK1 and I $\\kappa$ B kinase  $\\varepsilon$  [7,11].

STING overexpression activates IRF3 and suppresses viral replication, while RNA interference reducing STING expression inhibits IRF3 activation and increases viral replication. Although classically activated by bacteria and DNA viruses, STING also inhibits positive-strand RNA virus replication. In RNA virus infection, STING acts downstream of RIG-I and MAVS and upstream of TBK1, serving as a scaffold for the MAVS/TBK1/IRF3 complex and binding RIG-I (but not MDA5), MAVS, TBK1, and IκB kinase ε.

Ducks and geese are generally considered to be natural reservoirs or carriers of NDV while being resistant to NDV strains, even those most virulent for chickens [1]. However, outbreaks of ND have frequently occurred in geese throughout China since 1997, causing devastating economic losses [5-9]. Many NDV strains of different virulences have been isolated from diseased and clinically healthy ducks [10-25]. Some isolates were pathogenic for ducks, and natural ND cases in ducks have been gradually increasing in recent years [10,11,14,16-19,21,23-25], indicating that ducks may be not just reservoirs and carriers of NDV but also susceptible to infection with the disease.", "response": "Newcastle disease virus (NDV) can infect many bird species; at least 241 species across 27 of 50 avian orders are susceptible in natural or experimental infections.

{"query": "The interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immune response serves as the first line of host defense against invading viruses (Akira et al., 2006; Mogensen, 2009). Following pathogen detection and subsequent IFN production, IFN molecules bind to their cell-surface receptors and rapidly initiate a signaling cascade via the Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, leading to the induction of expression of a wide variety of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Kisseleva et al., 2002; Schneider et al., 2014). Upon IFN binding, IFN receptors undergo conformational changes and subsequently form dimeric or oligomeric complexes, which lead to JAK apposition and transphosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues, releasing their intrinsic catalytic activity (Levy and Darnell, 2002; Piehler et al., 2012). The activated JAKs in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domains of IFN receptors, providing binding sites for the Src-homology-2 (SH2) domain of the STAT proteins (Bousoik and Montazeri Aliabadi, 2018). After binding to the receptors, STAT proteins are phosphorylated by JAKs. Phosphorylated STATs dissociate from the receptor-JAK complexes, form homo- or heterodimers, and then translocate to the nucleus where they complex with other nuclear proteins and bind to IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and gamma-activated sequence (GAS) to regulate hundreds of ISGs expression (Sands et al., 2006). JAK-STAT signaling not only plays an important role in antiviral innate immunity, but also primes and shapes the adaptive immune response (Fleming, 2016; Villarino et al., 2015).", "response": "The interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immune response is a first-line defense against viral infection. After pathogens are detected, produced IFNs bind cell-surface receptors and trigger the JAK–STAT signaling cascade, inducing many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). IFN binding causes receptor conformational changes and dimer/oligomer formation, enabling JAK proximity and transphosphorylation that activates JAKs. Activated JAKs phosphorylate receptor cytoplasmic tyrosines, creating SH2-domain docking sites for STAT proteins, which are then phosphorylated by JAKs. Phosphorylated STATs detach, form homo- or heterodimers, move into the nucleus, and bind ISRE and GAS elements (with other nuclear factors) to regulate expression of hundreds of ISGs. Beyond antiviral innate immunity, JAK–STAT signaling also helps prime and shape adaptive immune responses."}

Because meat yield directly determines the level of economic benefits, the study of skeletal muscle development is important in animal husbandry production. The growth and development of duck skeletal muscle is an essential economic trait, which is determined by genetic, and influenced by nutritional and environmental factors. The development of embryonic skeletal muscle is a tightly regulated process that is critically modulated by genes and related signaling pathways [4,5]. During prenatal and very early postnatal development, muscle growth in vertebrates depends on an increasing number of muscle fibers (hyperplasia) [6,7]. After postnatal growth, the increase in skeletal muscle is mainly due to muscle hypertrophy, accompanied by the proliferation of satellite cells and then the new myonuclei is incorporated into existing myofibers [8].

{"query": "In mammals, TLR3 recognises double-stranded RNA from viral sources through its ectodomain to activate the down-steam pathway (Alexopoulou et al., 2001). Upon viral infection, phagocytes such as macrophages and dendritic cells take up virus-infected apoptotic cells. Viral RNAs may be released from these apoptotic cells in intracellular acidic compartments, such as phagosomes, by the action of lysosomal enzymes, and TLR3 is the receptor for viral RNAs and is indispensable for mounting anti-viral innate immune responses by inducing type I interferons (Alexopoulou et al., 2001; Hoebe et al., 2003; Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004). TLR3-deficient mice lacked the ability to optimise poly(A:U)-induced clonal T-cell expansion and prevented the production of interferon (IFN)- $\\gamma$  and interleukin (IL)-12p40 (Sugiyama et al., 2008).

{"query": "Avian divers needed to solve the biomechanical conflict between their primary adaptation, aimed towards flight, and their secondary adaptation, for swimming underwater.

Second, using wings for propulsion in both air and water is difficult because water is far denser (~850×) and more viscous (~55×) than air, making large wings inefficient underwater and small wings inefficient for flight; sharing one wing design therefore reduces efficiency in at least one mode.

{"query": "Type I interferon (IFN) acts as the first line of defense against invading viral pathogens (Rasmussen et al., 2009; Schoggins and Rice, 2011). Once host molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as viral nucleic acids or proteins, a series of signaling pathways involving dozens of conserved adaptor molecules and kinases are activated rapidly, resulting in the expression of type I IFN (Akira et al., 2006; Medzhitov, 2007; Takeuchi and Akira, 2009). Type I IFN production during viral infection upregulated hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) expression via Janus kinase/signal transducer and activation of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway, many of which could directly kill viruses within infected cells (Schoggins and Rice, 2011; Theofilopoulos et al., 2005). In this pathway, type I IFNs binding leads to IFN receptors oligomerization, which triggers phosphorylation of JAK molecules (Cohen et al., 1995; Levy and Darnell, 2002). Activated JAKs subsequently phosphorylate the key tyrosine residues within the intracellular domains of IFN receptors, which serve as docking sites for STAT proteins (Darnell et al., 1994). Thus, JAKs in turn phosphorylate both STAT1 and STAT2 proteins (Schindler et al., 1992). The phosphorylated STAT proteins dimerize, interact with IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 9, and then form the ISG factor 3 (ISGF3) complex (Qureshi et al., 1995). This ISGF3 complex then migrates to the nucleus, where it binds to IFN-stimulated regulatory elements (ISREs) in the ISG promoters, resulting in the transcription of hundreds of ISGs to limit virus replication and spread (Martinez-Moczygemba et al., 1997; Schoggins and Rice, 2011).", "response": "Type I interferon (IFN) is a first-line defense against viral infection.

Type I IFN then upregulates hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) through the JAK/STAT pathway, and many ISGs can directly inhibit or kill viruses in infected cells.

Phosphorylated STATs dimerize, associate with IRF9 to form the ISGF3 complex, which enters the nucleus and binds ISREs in ISG promoters, driving ISG transcription to limit viral replication and spread."}
{"query": "USP18 (also known as UBP43) is a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease (UBP) family (Liu et al., 1999; Schwer et al., 2000). The UBP family is composed of deubiquitinating enzymes that regulate the balance of protein ubiquitination in combination with the action of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in a variety of cellular events (Chung and Baek, 1999; D'Andrea and Pellman, 1998; Guo et al., 2014; Wing, 2003). The family members differ in protein size and amino acid sequence; however, all share several consensus sequences surrounding the cysteine residues (Cys domain) and histidine residues (His domain) that are required for catalytic activity of the enzyme (Hochstrasser, 1996). USP18 was originally identified as a type I interferon-responsive gene that is rapidly upregulated by IFN-  $\\beta$  treatment through the JAK/STAT kinase pathway (Kang et al., 2001). USP18 efficiently cleaves ISG15 conjugates, maintaining cellular homeostasis of ISG15-conjugated proteins (Malakhov et al., 2002). USP18 also negatively regulates type I IFN signaling independent of its ISG15 isopeptidase activity (Kim et al., 2006; Malakhova et al., 2006).", "response": "USP18 (UBP43) is a ubiquitin-specific protease (UBP) family deubiquitinating enzyme that helps regulate protein ubiquitination balance. Although UBP members vary in size and sequence, they share conserved cysteine and histidine domains required for catalytic activity. USP18 was first identified as a type I interferon–responsive gene rapidly induced by IFN-β via the JAK/STAT pathway. Functionally, it cleaves ISG15 conjugates to maintain homeostasis of ISG15-modified proteins and also suppresses type I interferon signaling through a mechanism independent of its ISG15 isopeptidase activity."}
{"query": "DTMUV is a contagious virus that severely reduces egg production 1-3. Infected ducks show severe neurological signs, such as uncoordinated gait and a reluctance or inability to walk  $^{1,2}$ . The morbidity and mortality rate of infected ducks ranges 20 to  $50\\%$  and 10 to  $30\\%$ , respectively<sup>1</sup>. This virus was first isolated from infected ducks in China in  $2010^2$ . After the initial outbreak, it rapidly spread to other intensive duck farming countries, including Malaysia  $^{4}$  and Thailand  $^{1}$ . Until now, no approved vaccinations or sufficient therapeutics have been developed. DTMUV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus classified in the genus Flavivirus in the Flaviviridae family, which includes other human neuropathogenic flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV).

{"query": "Estrogens belong to the gonadal steroid hormone family synthesized from cholesterol mainly in the ovaries, granulosa cells, and corpora lutea. They are also produced in other non-gonadal organs and tissues including the heart, liver, skin, brain, adipose tissue, and adrenal glands (1-4). In the reproductive system, estrogens regulate oogenesis, ovulation, estrous behavior, uterine propagation, vitellogenesis, endometrial gland secretions, gonadotropin secretions, male and female sex organ development, and secondary sex characteristics (1,3,5). Estrogens' biological and physiological functions are executed by binding to the cognate receptors known as estrogen receptors (ERs). The two main receptors found in poultry are estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1/ERα/ER1) and estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2/ERβ/ER2) which are found in the nuclear receptor superfamily (6-8). The ERs act as transcription factors to initiate gene transcription through estrogen response elements (EREs) in the target tissues and also interact with other transcription factors (9).", "response": "Estrogens are gonadal steroid hormones synthesized from cholesterol mainly in the ovaries (granulosa cells and corpora lutea), but they are also produced in several non-gonadal tissues such as the heart, liver, skin, brain, adipose tissue, and adrenal glands.

{"query": "The innate immune response is the first line of host defense against microbial pathogens. Various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play an essential role in detecting pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) associated with invading pathogens. PAMP recognition initiates an innate immune response, characterized by the production of type I interferon (IFN), proinflammatory cytokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (1, 2). PRRs comprise multiple family members, including toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and cytosolic dsDNA sensors (CDSs). RLRs primarily recognize  $5^{\\prime}$ -phosphorylated RNAs, including ssRNA or dsRNA produced during the replication of RNA or DNA viruses (3). Although RIG-I predominantly recognizes RNA viruses, the RIG-I/Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) pathway is also activated during infection with several DNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), Epstein-Barr virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (4-6). During infection with DNA viruses, RNA polymerase III recognizes AT-rich dsDNA and transcribes the dsDNA into dsRNA containing a 5-triphosphate moiety that activates the RIG-I/MAVS pathway to induce IFN- $\\beta$  production (7). DNA from viruses or bacteria can be detected by Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and potentially RLR, which potentially activate the endoplasmic reticulum-resident adaptor protein, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), to translocate from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, where it activates TBK1-IRF3 and -NF- $\\kappa$ B, resulting in robust induction of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokine production (8). IFN-I binds to IFNAR and activates R1-associated Tyk2 protein tyrosine kinase and the IFN-alpha/beta R2-associated Jak1 protein tyrosine kinase, which subsequently regulate the phosphorylation and activation of different STAT proteins; the activated STAT proteins homo- or heterodimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they promote the expression of numerous target genes. Binding of STAT proteins to either ISREs or GAS sites regulates the expression of several hundred ISGs, which mediate the anti-viral, anti-proliferative, and apoptotic effects of type I IFNs.", "response": "The innate immune response is the first line of defense against pathogens and is initiated when pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), leading to production of type I interferons (IFN), proinflammatory cytokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs).

RLRs mainly recognize 5′-phosphorylated viral RNAs (ssRNA or dsRNA) generated during virus replication; although RIG-I primarily senses RNA viruses, the RIG-I–MAVS pathway can also be activated by several DNA viruses. In DNA virus infection, RNA polymerase III can convert AT-rich dsDNA into 5′-triphosphate dsRNA that activates RIG-I/MAVS to induce IFN-β. Viral or bacterial DNA can be sensed by cGAS (and potentially RLRs), triggering STING movement from the ER to the Golgi to activate TBK1–IRF3 and NF-κB, inducing type I IFN and inflammatory cytokines. Type I IFN then signals through IFNAR, activating Tyk2 and Jak1 to phosphorylate STATs, which dimerize, enter the nucleus, and drive ISG expression via ISRE or GAS elements, producing antiviral, antiproliferative, and apoptotic effects."}
