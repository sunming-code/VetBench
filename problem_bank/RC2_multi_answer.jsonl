{"query": "Contextual materials: The pre-implantation period is a coordinated process between fertilization and embryo implantation in the endometrium of mammalian species. The first cellular cycles of the fertilized oocyte are controlled by maternal RNAs and proteins synthesized and stored during oogenesis (Crosby et al., 1988). Around the fourth cell cycle in ruminants, the embryo begins to produce its own transcripts and maternal RNAs and proteins are degraded and replaced. This process is called maternal-to-embryonic transition (Graf et al., 2014; Sanchez et al., 2019), and its onset differs among species. In sheep, full activation of embryo transcription occurs at the 8-16 cell stage (Crosby et al., 1988).

Prolonged vascular occlusion can lead to ischemia, oxygen and nutrient deprivation, and ultimately necrosis of the under-lying tissues with muscle being particularly vulnerable to pressure-induced injury (Linder-Ganz et al., 2006). Thus, it is important to seek metrics that are predictive for saddle-induced damage to underlying tissues. Minimal, maximal and mean pressures beneath the saddle have been suggested as relevant measures, with mean pressure showing the largest difference between saddle variants (Byström et al., 2010). Mean pressure is also more reliable than maximal pressure (De Cocq et al., 2006) and it differentiates more clearly between groups of horses with and without back pain (von Peinen et al., 2010).

{"query": "Contextual materials: The cuticle is an extremely thin proteinaceous layer, which plugs the entry to the shell pores and regulates the permeability to gases, liquids, and particles (Board and Halls 1973; Mortola 2009). The cuticle is deposited by the epithelial cells lining the hen uterus during the last 5 h before oviposition (Nys et al. 1999). The cuticle thickness on the eggs of domestic hens varies from 0.5 to 12.8 μm and can have an uneven or patchy distribution on the eggshell surface (Board and Halls 1973). Theoretically, the cuticle subserves diverse functions, varying from reducing water loss to the first lines of defense against bacterial penetration by blocking the external surface of pores (Kulshreshtha et al. 2018). It has been shown that cuticle composition is correlated with the hen age and egg ­freshness, and this information could be useful to design strategies to evaluate and reduce the contamination risks during egg processing (Rodríguez-­Navarro et al. 2013). The cuticle consists of 85–87% protein, 3.5–4.4% carbohydrates, 2.5–3.5% lipids, and 3.5% ash (Nys et al. 1999; Rose-­Martel et al. 2012; Rodríguez-­Navarro et al. 2013).

Which options, along with their stated justifications, align with recommended practices and established characteristics of the cuticle?\n\nA) When wet washing cannot be avoided, use wash water about 11 °C (20 °F) warmer than the egg to help prevent contaminants from being pulled inward through shell pores due to vacuum effects  \nB) Use wash water colder than the egg to promote outward flow through the pores, washing contaminants out without impacting the cuticle  \nC) Assume the cuticle is mainly mineral/ash-based and therefore resistant to harsh washing, so wash-water temperature differences are largely unimportant  \nD) Choose gentle dry brushing to remove organic material because washing may damage the very thin protein-based layer that plugs pores and controls permeability", "response": "AD", "Contextual materials": "The cuticle is an extremely thin proteinaceous layer, which plugs the entry to the shell pores and regulates the permeability to gases, liquids, and particles (Board and Halls 1973; Mortola 2009). The cuticle is deposited by the epithelial cells lining the hen uterus during the last 5 h before oviposition (Nys et al. 1999). The cuticle thickness on the eggs of domestic hens varies from 0.5 to 12.8 μm and can have an uneven or patchy distribution on the eggshell surface (Board and Halls 1973). Theoretically, the cuticle subserves diverse functions, varying from reducing water loss to the first lines of defense against bacterial penetration by blocking the external surface of pores (Kulshreshtha et al. 2018). It has been shown that cuticle composition is correlated with the hen age and egg ­freshness, and this information could be useful to design strategies to evaluate and reduce the contamination risks during egg processing (Rodríguez-­Navarro et al. 2013). The cuticle consists of 85–87% protein, 3.5–4.4% carbohydrates, 2.5–3.5% lipids, and 3.5% ash (Nys et al. 1999; Rose-­Martel et al. 2012; Rodríguez-­Navarro et al. 2013). It is recommended to lightly brush off any organic debris from eggs, rather than washing them, to prevent damage to the cuticle.

The CN of guppies is surrounded by an osseous coat, while that of red-tail shark is supported by a fibrous coat and this may be an adaptive means against squeezing the contents of the canal by high water pressures in the bottom."}

{"query": "Contextual materials: The most common abnormal urine color is pink, red, or reddish brown and can be attributed to intact red blood cells (RBC), hemolyzed RBC, muscle pigments, food pigments, or porphyrins (Figure 3). The most common cause of pink to red urine is the presence of intact RBC (hematuria) (Figure 4.4a–e). Intact RBC in urine impart a pink to brown color to urine, depending on the number of RBC, urine pH, and length of time the RBC have been in the urine [2]. A substantial number of RBC must be present in urine before a pink or red color is observed (Figure 4.5). Light pink color was observed in urine from dogs when approximately 600 RBC/hpf were present in the urine sediment and dark pink color was observed when 800–950 RBC/hpf were present [14]. Red color from intact RBC in urine clears with centrifugation or settling (Figure 4.6). Hemoglobinuria from intravascular hemolysis or lysis of previously intact red cells in the urine specimen (in vivo or in vitro) also may cause reddish color that persists in the supernatant after settling or centrifugation (Figure 4.7a,b). Uncommonly, the presence of myoglobinuria, or rarely porphyrinuria, may cause a reddish color (see also Chapter 5, occult blood).

Myxomatous mitral valve degeneration is prevalent in the canine, and most adult dogs develop some degree of mitral valve disease as they age, highlighting the apparent vulnerability of canine heart valves to injury. Myxomatous valvular remodeling is associated with characteristic histopathologic features.

Myxomatous mitral valve degeneration is prevalent in the canine, and most adult dogs develop some degree of mitral valve disease as they age, highlighting the apparent vulnerability of canine heart valves to injury. Myxomatous valvular remodeling is associated with characteristic histopathologic features. Changes include expansion of extracellular matrix with glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans; valvular interstitial cell alteration; and attenuation or loss of the collagen-laden fibrosa layer. These lead to malformation of the mitral apparatus, biomechanical dysfunction, and mitral incompetence. Mitral regurgitation is the most common manifestation of myxomatous valve disease and in advanced stages, associated volume overload promotes progressive valvular regurgitation, left atrial and left ventricular remodeling, atrial tears, chordal rupture, and congestive heart failure. Future studies are necessary to identify clinical-pathologic correlates that track disease severity and progression, detect valve dysfunction, and facilitate risk stratification.

In contrast, pheomelanosomes show no fibril formation presumably due to the lack of PMEL expression [3]. The fibrillary structures laterally assemble into sheets, which serve as a matrix for eumelanin deposition (reviewed by Watt and co-workers [4]).

Furthermore, in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD), MSCs ameliorate renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate [5]. Cats exhibit several inflammatory diseases. In particular, many elderly cats experience significant CKD-related problems [6]. On the other hand, feline MSCs (fMSCs) do not have a considerable effect on this disease [7]. In addition to the pathological conditions that depend on the species, the unsuccessful results in cats may be due to the lower biological activity of fMSC, the earlier loss of proliferative activity and stemness [8], and the poorer ability to produce bioactive mediators without stimulation [9]."}

USP18 also negatively regulates type I IFN signaling independent of its ISG15 isopeptidase activity (Kim et al., 2006; Malakhova et al., 2006).\nquery: Rewritten Question:  \nA scientist finds that exposure to IFN-β quickly upregulates a deubiquitinating enzyme that can both deconjugate ISG15 from target proteins and suppress type I interferon signaling even when its isopeptidase activity is inactivated. Which of the following statements align with the known characteristics of this enzyme?\n\nA) IFN-β induces this enzyme via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway as part of a type I interferon–responsive gene program  \nB) Its ability to inhibit type I IFN signaling is entirely due to ISG15 deconjugation, meaning this inhibitory effect depends on its ISG15 isopeptidase activity  \nC) The enzyme is a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease (UBP) family, whose proteins share conserved sequence motifs surrounding catalytic cysteine and histidine residues required for activity  \nD) By efficiently removing ISG15 from conjugated proteins, it helps maintain cellular homeostasis by controlling the abundance of ISG15-modified substrates", "response": "ACD", "Contextual materials": "USP18 (also known as UBP43) is a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease (UBP) family (Liu et al., 1999; Schwer et al., 2000). The UBP family is composed of deubiquitinating enzymes that regulate the balance of protein ubiquitination in combination with the action of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in a variety of cellular events (Chung and Baek, 1999; D'Andrea and Pellman, 1998; Guo et al., 2014; Wing, 2003). The family members differ in protein size and amino acid sequence; however, all share several consensus sequences surrounding the cysteine residues (Cys domain) and histidine residues (His domain) that are required for catalytic activity of the enzyme (Hochstrasser, 1996).

{"query": "Contextual materials: The innate immune response is the first line of host defense against microbial pathogens. Various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play an essential role in detecting pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) associated with invading pathogens. PAMP recognition initiates an innate immune response, characterized by the production of type I interferon (IFN), proinflammatory cytokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (1, 2). PRRs comprise multiple family members, including toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and cytosolic dsDNA sensors (CDSs). RLRs primarily recognize  $5^{\\prime}$ -phosphorylated RNAs, including ssRNA or dsRNA produced during the replication of RNA or DNA viruses (3). Although RIG-I predominantly recognizes RNA viruses, the RIG-I/Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) pathway is also activated during infection with several DNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), Epstein-Barr virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (4-6). During infection with DNA viruses, RNA polymerase III recognizes AT-rich dsDNA and transcribes the dsDNA into dsRNA containing a 5-triphosphate moiety that activates the RIG-I/MAVS pathway to induce IFN- $\\beta$  production (7). DNA from viruses or bacteria can be detected by Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and potentially RLR, which potentially activate the endoplasmic reticulum-resident adaptor protein, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), to translocate from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, where it activates TBK1-IRF3 and -NF- $\\kappa$ B, resulting in robust induction of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokine production (8). IFN-I binds to IFNAR and activates R1-associated Tyk2 protein tyrosine kinase and the IFN-alpha/beta R2-associated Jak1 protein tyrosine kinase, which subsequently regulate the phosphorylation and activation of different STAT proteins; the activated STAT proteins homo- or heterodimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they promote the expression of numerous target genes. Binding of STAT proteins to either ISREs or GAS sites regulates the expression of several hundred ISGs, which mediate the anti-viral, anti-proliferative, and apoptotic effects of type I IFNs.\nquery: A scientist detects strong IFN-β production after introducing AT-rich double-stranded DNA into mammalian cells. Which of the following mechanistic processes could reasonably explain this observation?\n\nA) RIG-I binds AT-rich dsDNA directly and activates STING without any RNA intermediate or MAVS involvement  \nB) RNA polymerase III converts the AT-rich dsDNA into 5′-triphosphorylated dsRNA that activates RIG-I and signals via MAVS  \nC) cGAS detects cytosolic DNA and activates STING movement from the ER to the Golgi, where STING triggers TBK1–IRF3 and NF-κB activation  \nD) The resulting type I IFN binds IFNAR, recruits Tyk2 and Jak1, activates STAT proteins, and drives ISG expression through ISRE or GAS motifs", "response": "BCD", "Contextual materials": "The innate immune response is the first line of host defense against microbial pathogens.
