Gingivitis is the initial, reversible stage of the disease process in which the active inflammation is restricted to the gingiva. This inflammation is initiated by plaque bacteria and may be reversed with a professional dental cleaning and proper home care. Periodontitis is the later stage of the disease process which results from inflammation-induced tissue destruction and can present in active or dormant phase. It is defined as an inflammatory disease of the deeper supporting structures of the tooth (periodontal ligament and alveolar bone) and is also caused by microorganisms. The genus Porphyromonas is one of the major periodontopathic bacteria in humans and companion animals (Norris and Love, 1999). There is a direct relationship between the development of gingivitis and the accumulation of dental plaque with an increase in numbers of the genus Porphyromonas.\nquery: In the context of periodontal disease in small animal patients, how do **gingivitis** and **periodontitis** differ with respect to **(1) whether the condition is reversible, (2) which oral tissues are chiefly involved, and (3) how plaque-associated microorganisms contribute, including the importance of the genus *Porphyromonas*?", "response": "Rubric (Total Score: 1.0 Point; Min Score: 0.0 Points)\n\n- **Gingivitis vs. periodontitis—reversibility (0.3 points)**  \n  - 0.3: Correctly states gingivitis is the initial **reversible** stage (reversible with professional cleaning and home care) and periodontitis is a later stage with **inflammation-induced tissue destruction** (not described as reversible).  \n  - 0.0: Does not correctly distinguish reversibility/destruction.\n\n- **Tissues affected (0.4 points)**  \n  - 0.2: Correctly identifies gingivitis inflammation is restricted to the **gingiva**.  \n  - 0.2: Correctly identifies periodontitis affects deeper supporting structures: **periodontal ligament and alveolar bone**.  \n  - 0.0–0.3: Partial/unclear identification of tissues.\n\n- **Microbial/plaque role and *Porphyromonas* significance (0.3 points)**  \n  - 0.15: States gingivitis inflammation is initiated by **plaque bacteria** (and periodontitis is also caused by microorganisms).  \n  - 0.15: States *Porphyromonas* is a major periodontopathic genus in humans/companion animals and its numbers increase with plaque accumulation and are directly related to gingivitis development.  \n  - 0.0–0.2: Mentions bacteria/plaque but misses *Porphyromonas* relationship or misstates it.\n\n- **Deductions for excess irrelevant content (max −0.25 points)**  \n  - Deduct 0.05–0.25 if the response adds substantial unrelated material (e.g., detailed prevalence statistics, unrelated systemic effects, treatment regimens beyond “professional cleaning and home care”) that obscures the required distinctions.  \n  - Final score cannot be below 0.0."}

This distribution of internal forces is in agreement with the arrangement of the compression-resistant skeleton (vertebral column and sternum, pelvis, (Preuschoft & Fritz, 1977)) and the tension-producing musculature (neck, cranial thoracic dorsal musculature and several shoulder muscles, as detailed in Kienapfel (2014)). Aside from the muscles, there exist very strong strands of connective tissue, which can take over at least part of the tensile forces, and are claimed by several researchers (Gellman & Bertram, 2002; Nickel, Schummer, Seiferle, & Frewein, 2004; Slijper, 1946; Zschokke, 1892) to do so.\nquery: In the “heavy-beam” model of a quadruped supported by the fore- and hindlimbs, specify (i) which margins of the head-and-neck anterior cantilever are under compression versus tension when it bends downward and (ii) which margins of the trunk between the limb supports experience compression versus tension as the trunk droops ventrally, and name the key anatomical components mainly responsible for bearing compressive loads versus generating/withstanding tensile loads.", "response": "Rubric (Total = 1.0 point; Minimum = 0):  \n- (0.25) Anterior cantilever (head/neck) stress pattern correctly stated: lower margin in compression AND upper margin in tension.  \n- (0.25) Trunk-between-supports stress pattern correctly stated: upper margin in compression AND lower margin in tension (due to ventral sagging).  \n- (0.25) Compression-resisting structures correctly identified as the skeleton, specifically including vertebral column and sternum (pelvis acceptable as additional correct detail).  \n- (0.25) Tension-handling structures correctly identified as musculature (e.g., neck and cranial thoracic dorsal/shoulder muscles) AND/or strong connective-tissue strands that can take over part of tensile forces.  \n\nDeductions (max 0.25):  \n- Deduct up to 0.25 for excessive irrelevant content that obscures the required stress patterns/structures (e.g., lengthy digressions into unrelated biomechanics), scaled by severity.

Although endemic in Equidae in sub-Saharan Africa, outbreaks have also been recorded in north Africa, the middle and near east and southern Europe (MacLachlan & Guthrie 2010).

{"query": "Contextual materials: Clostridium difficile is considered one of the most important causes of diarrhea and enterocolitis in horses. Foals and adult horses are equally susceptible to the infection. The highly resistant spore of  $C$  difficile is the infectious unit of transmission, which occurs primarily via the fecal-oral route, with sources of infection including equine feces, contaminated soil, animal hospitals, and feces of other animals. Two major risk factors for the development of  $C$  difficile associated disease (CDAD) in adult horses are hospitalization and antimicrobial treatment, although sporadically, cases of CDAD can occur in horses that have not received antimicrobials or been hospitalized. The most common antibiotics associated with CDAD in horses are erythromycin, trimethoprim/sulfonamides,  $\\beta$ -lactam antimicrobials, clindamycin, rifampicin, and gentamicin. Clinical signs and intestinal lesions of CDAD infection are not specific and they cannot be used to distinguish infections by  $C$  difficile from infections by other agents, such as Clostridium perfringens or Salmonella sp. The distribution of lesions throughout the intestinal tract seems to be age-dependent. Small intestine is invariably affected, and colon and cecum may or may not have lesions in foals  $< 1$ -month old. Naturally acquired disease in older foals and adult horses has a more aboral distribution, affecting colon and sometimes cecum, but rarely the small intestine.

Naturally occurring LPS, a vital component of the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria, is made up of 3 distinct structural parts. $^{16}$  The outermost polysaccharide O antigen domain of LPS is a repetitive glycan polymer that varies from strain to strain and is a target for recognition by host antibodies; this is connected to a core domain that consists of less variant oligosaccharides.

Reassortment of human A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with North American swine influenza viruses containing the triple reassortant internal gene (TRIG) cassette was also identified resulting in numerous genome constellations found in pigs since the 2009 pandemic (6, 7).

The significance of A. dhakensis may have been overlooked in disease events of aquatic animals due to issues with reliable identification. Critical to appreciating the importance of this pathogen is the application of dependable molecular tools that enable accurate identification and discrimination from A. hydrophila and other motile aeromonads. This review aims to synthesise the key literature on A. dhakensis, particularly with relevance to aquaculture, including knowledge of the bacterium derived from disease case studies in aquatic hosts.

Six SAV subtypes have been identified based on the nucleic acid sequences encoding proteins E2 and nsP3 (Fringuelli et al. 2008), namely SAV subtypes 1-6. The SAV subtype 2 is divided into two subgroups: the freshwater variant, SAV2 FW, and the marine variant, marine SAV2. SAV2 FW typically causes sleeping disease (SD) in freshwater-reared rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum)) in England, Scotland and a number of countries on the European mainland (Graham et al. 2007a).

{"query": "Contextual materials: The cuticle is an extremely thin proteinaceous layer, which plugs the entry to the shell pores and regulates the permeability to gases, liquids, and particles (Board and Halls 1973; Mortola 2009). The cuticle is deposited by the epithelial cells lining the hen uterus during the last 5 h before oviposition (Nys et al. 1999). The cuticle thickness on the eggs of domestic hens varies from 0.5 to 12.8 μm and can have an uneven or patchy distribution on the eggshell surface (Board and Halls 1973). Theoretically, the cuticle subserves diverse functions, varying from reducing water loss to the first lines of defense against bacterial penetration by blocking the external surface of pores (Kulshreshtha et al. 2018). It has been shown that cuticle composition is correlated with the hen age and egg ­freshness, and this information could be useful to design strategies to evaluate and reduce the contamination risks during egg processing (Rodríguez-­Navarro et al. 2013). The cuticle consists of 85–87% protein, 3.5–4.4% carbohydrates, 2.5–3.5% lipids, and 3.5% ash (Nys et al. 1999; Rose-­Martel et al. 2012; Rodríguez-­Navarro et al. 2013). It is recommended to lightly brush off any organic debris from eggs, rather than washing them, to prevent damage to the cuticle.

{"query": "Contextual materials: Mobilization of glucose from glycogen stores requires two reactions: shortening of the nonreducing ends of α -1,4 glycosidic chains by a regulatory phosphorylase, and disassembly of the \\(\\alpha-1,6\\) branch points by a non-regulatory debranching enzyme. The first reaction adds inorganic phosphate (Pi) rather than \\(H_{2} O\\) across the glycosidic bond, resulting in the release of Glc-1-P which can then be converted to Glc-6-P by PGM. The second reaction removes a free glucose residue from glycogen which can be quickly phosphorylated to Glc-6-P and used in the Embden-Meyerhoff pathway (EMP), or released by liver tissue into blood (Fig. 23-4). Additionally, Glc-6-P may also be dephosphorylated by hepatic Glu-6-Pase, and released as free glucose into blood.

{"query": "Contextual materials: A Wood’s lamp examination is one of the simplest screening tools for dermatophytosis, but is only useful for some strains of \\(M.\\) canis, since only \\(M.\\) canis produces the classic emerald or apple-­green fluorescence of the hair shaft (Figure 9). In the hands of a skilled user, a Wood’s lamp will detect positive \\(M.\\) canis infection approximately 70–100% of the time (Moriello et al. 2017). Unfortunately, lint, skin surface crust and debris, and topical medications can cause similar fluorescence, which can lead to false positive results. Glowing hairs should be plucked and examined under the microscope for confirmation of the diagnosis. Hairs treated with appropriate topical therapy will not cease to fluoresce; but only the infected portion will glow, so a simple trick for monitoring response to treatment is to watch for loss of fluorescence as hairs grow out. Direct microscopic evaluation of infected hairs is another reliable diagnostic tool in the hands of a skilled examiner. Hairs from the edge of a lesion are plucked and placed on a slide with mineral oil and a coverslip. They are evaluated for the presence of hyphae and arthrospores on 100× power. Lowering and closing the condenser can increase contrast, which allows spores and hyphae to stand out. Infected hairs tend to be larger in diameter with a fuzzy or irregular outline, and they lack a clear demarcation between the cortex and the medulla. Most dermatophyte infections in animals produce an ectothrix distribution of arthrospores: coccoid elements surrounding the outside of the hair shaft. Hyphae will be seen growing within the hair shaft (Figure 6.10). Use of a Wood’s lamp to highlight actively glowing hairs on the microscope slide can assist in identification of M. canis.\nquery: A veterinarian screens a suspected dermatophyte case with a Wood’s lamp and notes an apple‑green glow on the hair shafts.

{"query": "Contextual materials: Macrolide antibiotics and similar molecules are active against gram-­positive (S. aureus, Streptococcus spp.) and atypical pathogens (Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma spp.), but have a limited spectrum against gram-­negative organisms. Macrolides are ineffective against enteric gram-­ negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli and are ineffective against P. aeruginosa. They are active against fastidious gram-­negative organisms (Campylobacter spp., Borrelia spp., Bordetella spp., Brucella spp., Pasteurella spp., Haemophilus spp., H. pylori) and spirochetes (Treponema pallidum). Some differences exist in the overlapping spectrums of each macrolide antibiotic. Macrolides and their relatives are bacteriostatic agents that block bacterial protein synthesis. Macrolides may also inhibit production of bacterial virulence factors (Kanoh and Rubin 2010), may have anti-­inflammatory properties (Rubin and Tamaoki 2000; Culić et al. 2001), immunomodulatory activity (Piacentini et al. 2007), and effects on cell signaling (Clapham 2007). Resistance to macrolides and related compounds occurs in three ways (Nakajima 1999; Leclercq and Courvalin 2002). The first is target site modification by methylation or other mutation that prevents binding of the drug to the ribosomal target. For example, the A2059G mutation confers high-­level resistance to macrolides such as erythromycin and azithromycin, moderate resistance to clarithromycin and clindamycin, but no resistance to streptogramins (Tait-­Kamradt et al. 2000; Canu et al. 2002). The second is efflux mediated by physiologic pumps that actively pump the drug out of the bacterial cell and are encoded by the mef (A) gene with efflux driven by proton motive force (Clancy et al. 1996).

{"query": "Contextual materials: Malassezia dermatitis can be treated with topical or systemic antifungals alone or in combination. Combination therapy may lead to faster resolution of disease. Topical therapy alone or pulse dosing of oral therapy can be used as prevention once infection and underlying disease are better controlled. Topical therapy is available as a shampoo, spray, wipe, mousse, or gel and should contain 2% chlorhexidine with 2% miconazole or ketoconazole, 3–4% chlorhexidine when it is the sole active ingredient, 1–2% miconazole, or 2% climbazole. A frequency of two to three times per week for three to four weeks is recommended for active infection; this can be reduced to one to two times per week for maintenance and prevention. The author prefers shampoo for generalized infections and wipes for facial fold, claw fold, and interdigital treatment.

{"query": "Contextual materials: Idiopathic Megaesophagus Idiopathic megaesophagus is the most common cause of regurgitation in the dog.10 Aside from dysautonomia, megaesophagus is a rare finding in the domestic cat. The disorder is characterized by esophageal hypomotility and dilation, progressive regurgitation, and loss of body condition. Several forms of the syndrome have been described, including congenital, acquired secondary, and acquired idiopathic megaesophagus. Dysautonomia Dysautonomia is a generalized autonomic neuropathy that was originally reported in cats in the United Kingdom, but that has now been documented in dogs and cats throughout Western Europe and the United States.11,12 Clinical signs reflect a generalized autonomic dysfunction but megaesophagus, esophageal hypomotility, and regurgitation are fairly consistent findings. Pathologically, degenerative lesions are found in autonomic ganglia, intermediate gray columns of the spinal cord, and some sympathetic axons. No definitive etiology has ever been established despite an intensive search for genetic, toxic, nutritional, and infectious etiologic agents. Gastroesophageal Intussusception Gastroesophageal intussusception is a rare condition of young dogs (most younger than 3 months of age) resulting from invagination of stomach into the esophagus, with or without other abdominal organs (e.g., spleen, duodenum, pancreas, omentum).17 Many affected animals have preexisting esophageal disease, most importantly idiopathic megaesophagus. The role of idiopathic megaesophagus in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal intussusception is not well understood, but it may be that the greatly enlarged capacity of a dilated esophagus accommodates invagination of the stomach through the diaphragmatic hiatus.

{"query": "Contextual materials: Cutaneous xanthomas are rare granulomatous skin lesions that occur in both dogs and cats because of an abnormality in lipid metabolism. High-­fat diets and diabetes mellitus can be associated with these skin lesions in both species and hereditary hyperlipoproteinemia has been seen in cats with xanthomas. Patients may present with white or yellow papules, nodules, or plaques with surrounding erythema. The lesions may ulcerate with time and can be pruritic or painful. Typical locations involved include the head, distal limbs, feet, and bony prominences. Differential diagnoses for cutaneous xanthomas include sterile nodular panniculitis, sterile granuloma/pyogranuloma syndrome, and neoplasia. Diagnosis is made by histopathology, which reveals foamy macrophages with multinucleated giant cells and lipid lakes throughout the dermis. If the patient is a cat, remember to check lipid levels on a serum chemistry panel. Tissue samples from nodular lesions should also be submitted for bacterial and fungal cultures and secondary infections should be addressed. Deep skin scrapings and fungal culture should also be performed if the patient is pruritic or has spreading lesions.

Equally, C. psittaci can be isolated as a cause of the abortion and there is no ocular disease. There is no doubt that there is a crossover infection between sheep and goats as C. psittaci occurs in wild sheep and goats which act as a reservoir for the infection throughout the world.

Regardless of the cause of the disease, it always shows a sequential pathogenesis. As many animals are likely to be affected, the clinician will see all the phases at one time.

{"query": "Contextual materials: H. parasuis strains are heterogeneous and exhibit a wide variability in the degree of virulence, from non-virulent to highly virulent strains. Non-virulent strains are commonly found in the upper respiratory tract as part of the normal microbiota of the animals, where do not cause any pathology. These strains are susceptible to the killing action of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) and, under normal conditions, are effectively cleared from the lungs (Fig. 4). If these strains reach the lung, they are detected by PAM, which are then activated for an effective phagocytosis and killing. Non-virulent strains are also sensitive to serum, and cannot survive in blood for systemic dissemination. These characteristics explain why non-virulent strains are not able to cause disease in healthy animals and are controlled by the innate immune system. On the opposite side, virulent strains can evade the immune system and cause disease. After the initial colonization of the upper respiratory tract, virulent strains can reach the lung, where they survive due to their ability to resist phagocytosis. After nasal inoculation, virulent strains can be found colonizing not only the nasal mucosa, but also the tracheal mucosa, where they can form biofilm-like structures. When virulent strains reach the lung, they are confronted by PAM. The interaction between virulent \\(H.\\) parasuis and PAM is limited and macrophage activation is delayed. During lung infection, \\(H.\\) parasuis adapt its metabolism to survive in the lung environment and express the necessary virulence factors to resist host defences (Fig. 4). Bacterial capsule and two surface proteins from the trimeric autotransporter family, named VtaA8 and VtaA9 (virulence-associated trimeric autotransporters o VtaA), play a role in phagocytosis resistance. Survival of virulent \\(H.\\) parasuis in the lung induces inflammation, including neutrophil recruitment, which may result in suppurative bronchopneumonia.

This later location of \\(H.\\) parasuis within pneumocytes may serve as a reservoir for persistent infections.\nquery: Why do non-virulent *Haemophilus parasuis* strains generally not produce systemic illness in otherwise healthy pigs, and how does this differ from the main immune-avoidance and persistence strategies that allow virulent strains to remain viable in the lungs and potentially cause sustained infection?", "response": "Rubric (Total = 1.0 point; minimum = 0.0):  \n\n- **0.5 points (Non-virulent strain control and lack of dissemination):** The answer correctly states BOTH of the following:\n  - Non-virulent strains are effectively recognized, phagocytosed, and killed by porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM), leading to clearance from the lungs.  \n  - Non-virulent strains are serum-sensitive and therefore cannot survive in blood to disseminate systemically.  \n\n- **0.5 points (Virulent strain mechanisms in lung and persistence):** The answer correctly states at least TWO of the following virulence-associated features (at least one must be immune-evasion related):\n  - Resistance to phagocytosis and delayed/limited activation of PAM during lung infection.  \n  - Use of capsule and/or the trimeric autotransporter surface proteins VtaA8 and VtaA9 to promote phagocytosis resistance.  \n  - Formation of biofilm-like structures on respiratory mucosa (e.g., tracheal mucosa) after colonization.  \n  - Intracellular/close association in the lung with host cells (neutrophils/macrophages and especially pneumocytes), with pneumocyte localization serving as a reservoir for persistent infection.  \n\n- **Deductions for excess/irrelevant content (max deduction = 0.25 points):**  \n  - Deduct **0.10–0.25** if the response adds substantial unrelated material (e.g., treatments, unrelated pathogens, extensive clinical signs not needed to answer the mechanism question) such that the core mechanisms are obscured.  \n  - Final score cannot be below **0.0**."}
{"query": "Contextual materials: The most common abnormal urine color is pink, red, or reddish brown and can be attributed to intact red blood cells (RBC), hemolyzed RBC, muscle pigments, food pigments, or porphyrins (Figure 3). The most common cause of pink to red urine is the presence of intact RBC (hematuria) (Figure 4.4a–e). Intact RBC in urine impart a pink to brown color to urine, depending on the number of RBC, urine pH, and length of time the RBC have been in the urine [2]. A substantial number of RBC must be present in urine before a pink or red color is observed (Figure 4.5). Light pink color was observed in urine from dogs when approximately 600 RBC/hpf were present in the urine sediment and dark pink color was observed when 800–950 RBC/hpf were present [14]. Red color from intact RBC in urine clears with centrifugation or settling (Figure 4.6). Hemoglobinuria from intravascular hemolysis or lysis of previously intact red cells in the urine specimen (in vivo or in vitro) also may cause reddish color that persists in the supernatant after settling or centrifugation (Figure 4.7a,b). Uncommonly, the presence of myoglobinuria, or rarely porphyrinuria, may cause a reddish color (see also Chapter 5, occult blood). Rarely, dyes used in the manufacture of some dry dog foods or ingestion of an unusual food item will impart a pink color to the urine. Discoloration caused by free hemoglobin, myoglobin, porphyrin, or dyes will persist in the urine supernatant after centrifugation, because they are dissolved in the urine. The term “beeturia” has been used to describe pink to deep red discolored urine from human patients after eating beets or foods that have been colored with beet pigments. Betacyanuria is the preferred scientific term that describes these red pigments in urine. Betanin and its epimer isobetanin contribute most of this red color. Urine can become progressively pinker when beetroot pigments are exposed to sunlight. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can be used to definitively identify beetroot pigments in urine, but this is not clinically necessary since beeturia is a benign condition.

The most common causes of pneumothorax in dogs are likely blunt force trauma from car collisions or penetrating trauma from an inhaled foreign body. Exposure to porcupine quills has also resulted in pneumothorax in the northern United States and Canada (Sevy et al. 2023).

{"query": "Contextual materials: The fracture reduction can be achieved either by closed, open, or semi-open method. Reduction of fracture without incising the skin or exposing the bone, through external manipulation, is called closed reduction. The technique involves holding the major bone segments over the skin, separating the impacted broken ends by traction if needed and then aligning them to the near normal anatomical position. Normally, after a closed reduction, fracture is immobilized with an external fixation technique, although in certain internal fixation, reduction can be achieved externally as in fresh cases of incomplete/greenstick fractures of femur in young animals without bone displacement. Closed reduction is generally indicated in fresh lower limb fractures, comprising only two bone pieces with little or no overriding of the bone segments.

{"query": "Contextual materials: Myoglobin and free hemoglobin impart a reddish color to the urine that does not clear with settling or centrifugation (Figure 8a,b). Both pigments can turn darker over time, while the sample awaits analysis, but myoglobin more consistently turns reddish-­brown to brown in color [2]. In this situation, the reagent pad will be positive for occult blood (see Chapter 5), but intact erythrocytes are not seen in the urinary sediment. In patients with hemoglobinuria, the serum will be pink owing to hemoglobin binding to haptoglobin. Myoglobin has no carrier protein, and its presence does not result in discoloration of serum because it is rapidly cleared from the circulation. A simple screening test using ammonium sulfate can discriminate between myoglobin and hemoglobin in urine. Myoglobin in urine largely stays in solution when exposed to 80% saturation of urine with ammonium sulfate, whereas hemoglobin is completely precipitated [16]. Although evaluation of serum color and use of ammonium sulfate precipitation testing can presumptively distinguish between hemoglobinuria and myoglobinuria, definitive differentiation requires urinary protein electrophoresis. Myoglobinuria probably occurs more commonly than diagnosed because it is easily confused with hemoglobinuria. Myoglobinuria sometimes is observed with exertional rhabdomyolysis in horses and dogs, and during postanesthetic rhabdomyolysis in horses [17–19]. Porphyrins in urine turn red after oxidation of porphobilinogen. This color intensifies upon standing and often is described as red or port wine [3]. The color of the urine supernatant does not change after centrifugation. In cats, porphyrinuria has been described as imparting an orange–brown color to urine that becomes orange–pink during fluorescence. Teeth of affected cats are also discolored with an orange–brown shade and undergo red fluorescence [20–23]. Intermittent porphyria and congenital erythropoietic porphyria have been described in cats [23]. Rabbits often can have red urine as a result of ingesting porphyrins in cabbage, carrots, dandelions, parsley or broccoli, and this red color can be a normal finding [24]. King George III of England (1738–1820) reportedly had urine that was blue as a consequence of hereditary intermittent porphyria [25].\nquery: A urine specimen appears evenly red-brown and the supernatant stays colored after centrifugation; the dipstick is positive for occult blood, yet no intact red blood cells are present on sediment exam.

{"query": "Contextual materials: Diagnosis of feline heartworm disease remains difficult. Peripheral eosinophilia is present in \\(<50\\%\\) of cases. Radiographic findings in feline heartworm disease are reflected by enlargement of caudal pulmonary lobar arteries to greater than 6 times the size of the ninth rib (Figure 8.5). However, in some cases pulmonary infiltrates can obscure visualization of the vasculature, and in one study of naturally infected cats, abnormalities in the pulmonary vasculature were uncommon (Venco et al. 2008). Unlike dogs, cardiac chambers are unlikely to be changed by heartworm infection. Focal or diffuse bronchointerstitial infiltrates are the most common parenchymal changes in cats with heartworm, but the presence and type of infiltrates depend on the stage of disease (Venco et al. 2008). Heartworm antibody positivity indicates only exposure to heartworm, and false-­ negative tests are unfortunately common. The antigen test can detect a single female heartworm, but can be falsely negative when no females are present or when only a few live males are present. Also, antigen–antibody complex formation appears to be more problematic in cats than in dogs, and heat-­treating serum leads to a substantial increase in positive antigen tests in infected cats (Little et al. 2014). This methodology is not advised as a screening test however, because of an increase in false-­positive results.

{"query": "Contextual materials: Blood collection can be particularly challenging in amphibians. Alcohol should not be used to clean the venipuncture site. This can irritate and/or desiccate the patient’s skin. A 1:40 diluted 2% chlorhexidine solution should be used to cleanse the site instead. Venipuncture in salamanders is generally performed using the caudal tail vein. This is the same technique described previously for both lizards and snakes. It is important to remember that the vessel is very small and can collapse easily; therefore, do not place a large amount of negative pressure on the syringe during collection. A 25- to 27-gauge needle attached to a 1-mL syringe should be used. An insulin syringe can also be used for very small patients. The blood sample should be placed in a heparinized Microtainer tube for analysis. Venipuncture sites in frogs and toads include the femoral vein, ventral abdominal vein, and the lingual vein. The femoral and lingual veins are rarely used. The ventral abdominal vein is by far the easiest vessel to obtain a blood sample from. The frog or toad is gently positioned on its back with the restrainer holding the pectoral girdle. The person drawing blood can hold the pelvic girdle with one hand and draw blood with the other hand. Restraint without gloves can damage the epithelium and cause subsequent elevated white blood cell counts. Some amphibians will need to be anesthetized for venipuncture.

{"query": "Contextual materials: ‘Mouth rot’ is the colloquial term for stomatitis, commonly seen in many reptiles particularly in snakes and chelonians. The causes are many and varied. It can be caused by secondary infections with Gram-negative bacteria. The initial cause of the damage can be rubbing of the snout on vivarium glass, particularly in snakes. The use of opaque tape stuck to the outside of the glass helps the snake to ‘see it’, preventing this injury. Stomatitis may also be due to the overzealous force-feeding of anorectic reptiles or to other disease or stresses leading to reduced immune system function. Uric acid crystals deposited around the base of the teeth, due to visceral gout and renal failure, can allow infections to occur. Herpesvirus and ranavirus infections in terrestrial tortoises are also a cause, with oral ulceration and diphtherisis (see Figure 9). Mycoplasma spp. infections may also be associated with stomatitis in tortoises. Devriesea agamarum, a bacterium, has been reported in agamid lizards as a cause of proliferative cheilitis, pericloacal disease and dermatitis. Adenoviruses have been implicated in snakes and lizards and IBD in snakes. Diagnosis is made on impression smears and bacterial swab and culture of samples. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnos\u0002ing many of the reptilian viral diseases is now commercially available, and reptile cell lines are available in some laboratories to attempt virus isolation where PCR is not accessible.

SAV is an enveloped spherical virus measuring 60–70 nm in diameter belonging to the genus Alphavirus and family Togaviridae. The genome consists of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of approximately 12 kb. The genome codes for eight proteins, four of which are non-structural proteins (nsP1–nsP4), and the remaining four are capsid glycoproteins (E1, E2, E3 and 6K). Glycoprotein E2 induces neutralizing antibodies [21] and, hence, is an ideal candidate for developing sub-unit or DNA vaccines. Based on the sequences of protein E2 and nsP3, SAV isolates have been divided into six genotypes, SAV1–SAV6 [134]. Gills and intestinal track are the portals of entry. Although the predilection sites of the virus are not known, in acute cases, high titre of the virus is found in kidney, heart, blood, and several other organs. Virus is shed through mucus and faeces. Disease outbreaks are influenced by environmental factors, and increase in water temperature favours the virus [135]. The disease affects all life-stages in both freshwater and seawater [136].

They are divided into at least 18 genotypes (named I to XVIII), and vNDV belonging to multiple class II genotypes are identified in poultry outbreaks worldwide (Dimitrov et al., 2016). vNDV from different genotypes are often identified in wild birds, and the latter have been speculated to play a role in the spread of the virus (Snoeck et al., 2013). However, it is suggested that most of the wild bird isolations are a result of spillover of virus from infected poultry (Miller and Koch, 2013). Notably, there are two known exceptions where virulent viruses are endemic in wild birds. Birds of the family Columbidae are known to be a reservoir of the antigenic variants of vNDV, commonly referred to as pigeon paramyxoviruses 1 (PPMV-1). These pigeon-origin viruses are distributed worldwide, are commonly isolated from both wild and domestic pigeons, and are highly virulent for these species (Ujvari et al., 2003).

Within the past decade, scientists demonstrated the obligate nature of this symbiosis by treating pathogenic nematodes with antibiotics, which quickly curtailed embryogenesis, progression of larval stages, and growth of adult worms (Slatko et al. 2010). It is now widely accepted by those within the field of heartworm research that the presence of W. pipientis within the bodies of adult worms is vital to survival and reproduction.

{"query": "Contextual materials: Canine atopic dermatitis is a complex disease that is often treated by multiple therapies either at the same time or over time. Most studies regarding efficacy are based on evaluating these drugs as sole therapy. Monotherapy is not frequently used in clinical practice because combination therapy is often necessary or more beneficial. The most common therapeutic interventions for CAD include the following: glucocorticoids, ciclosporin, antihistamines, essential fatty acids (EFAs) and allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT). Historically, glucocorticoids have been the most commonly prescribed medication for treatment of CAD, but even these are often used in conjunction with other therapies, such as bathing, antihistamines and fatty acids. Antihistamines have been described as having little benefit in managing atopic dermatitis;[3-5] however, antihistamines remain one of the most frequently used medications to treat the pruritus associated with CAD in dogs. Essential fatty acids, being commonly available and relatively inexpensive, are also frequently used in combination with other therapies. The slow onset of improvement with ASIT in dogs frequently results in the concurrent use of other therapies, at least during the first few months of therapy. Intermittent antimicrobial therapy is often necessary to eliminate complicating secondary infections. The most recent recommendation of the International Task Force on Canine Atopic Dermatitis focuses on this concept of a multimodal treatment approach.[4] A multimodal treatment approach will provide increased benefit to the dog by intervening at several different points along the pathway from exposure to an offending antigen to development of clinical signs (pruritus, superficial pyoderma and otitis externa).\nquery: In treating canine atopic dermatitis in clinical practice, what makes a multimodal (combination) treatment plan more commonly preferred than using a single therapy alone, and in what ways do three individual options (selected from glucocorticoids, ciclosporin, antihistamines, essential fatty acids, allergen-specific immunotherapy, and intermittent antimicrobials) each help overcome distinct real-world treatment needs or constraints?", "response": "Rubric (Total Score: 1.0 point; Minimum: 0 points):  \n- 0.30 points: States a valid overarching rationale for multimodal therapy (any one): monotherapy efficacy data may not reflect real-world practice; combination is often necessary/more beneficial; multimodal approach targets multiple points from antigen exposure to clinical signs; concurrent management of complications (secondary infections).  \n- 0.60 points: Correctly explains three distinct interventions (0.20 each) with a specific practical need/limitation they address:  \n  - Glucocorticoids: commonly prescribed; often used with bathing/antihistamines/fatty acids (combination use).  \n  - Antihistamines: limited benefit for atopic dermatitis overall but still frequently used to treat pruritus.  \n  - Essential fatty acids: inexpensive/common; frequently used in combination.  \n  - Allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT): slow onset; other therapies often used concurrently during first months.  \n  - Intermittent antimicrobials: used as needed to eliminate secondary infections.  \n  - Ciclosporin: acceptable as a listed common intervention (credit only if linked to combination/multimodal use; no extra details required).  \n- 0.10 points: Coherence and completeness—answer clearly connects multimodal rationale to the three chosen interventions without contradicting the listed facts.  \n- Deductions (max 0.25 points): Subtract 0.05–0.25 for excessive irrelevant content that obscures the required points (e.g., detailed pathophysiology, dosing regimens, or therapies not listed).

{"query": "Contextual materials: Amidst the overarching resemblance in mammary gland morphology and activity, a notable discrepancy in mammary predisposition to tumorigenesis emerges within various members of the mammalian class, suggesting differences in the stringency of controlling normal development and homeostasis. This discrepancy can be broadly categorized according to dietary preference: mammals belonging to the carnivore/omnivore taxa are susceptible to breast cancer, whereas herbivores are much less exposed (reviewed in [18, 19]). For example, mammary tumors are the most common neoplasm in female dogs, with up to  $50\\%$  being malignant [20]. In cats, mammary tumors account for about  $17\\%$  of all neoplasms, with  $80 - 90\\%$  being malignant [21]. Wild carnivores, such as jungle cats, jaguars, leopards, lions, and tigers also develop mammary tumors, which exhibit morphological patterns similar to those in human breast cancer [19]. In contrast, mammary tumors have rarely been reported in domestic mares [22, 23], cows (Table 1), ewes [24], goats, or sows [25]. Mammary cancer is also rare in zoo and freeranging ungulates [26-28]. These significant differences in mammary gland tumor development may have contributed to the generally lower mortality rates observed in clovenhooved domestic or zoo mammals—compared to carnivores [29]. Pigs are cloven-hoofed animals and omnivores, capable of consuming both plant and animal matter. Notably, there are significant morphological similarities between their mammary glands and the human breast. A review of the literature by Morey-Matamalas and colleagues [30] highlights that naturally occurring mammary tumors are rare in pigs. However, porcine epithelial cells have been shown to develop neoplasia following oncogenic transformation and subsequent injection into mouse mammary glands [31]. This observation emphasizes the critical influence of the host environment on tumorigenesis and suggests that pigs may occupy an intermediate position between carnivores and herbivores in their susceptibility to mammary cancer.\nquery: How do carnivorous and omnivorous mammals compare with herbivorous mammals in their likelihood of developing mammary (breast) cancer, and what particular findings justify describing pigs as an intermediate case in mammary tumor susceptibility?", "response": "Rubric (Total = 1.0 point; Min = 0.0 points):  \n- 0.5 points: Correctly states the overall pattern that carnivores/omnivores are generally susceptible to mammary (breast) cancer, while herbivores show much lower/rare occurrence.  \n- 0.25 points: Provides at least one correct supporting example with malignancy/occurrence figures for carnivores (e.g., female dogs: mammary tumors most common neoplasm; up to ~50% malignant; cats: ~17% of neoplasms with ~80–90% malignant; wild carnivores also develop similar-pattern tumors).  \n- 0.25 points: Correctly explains why pigs can be seen as intermediate by citing both (i) naturally occurring mammary tumors are rare in pigs and (ii) porcine epithelial cells can become neoplastic after oncogenic transformation and form tumors when introduced into mouse mammary glands, highlighting the importance of host environment.\n\nDeductions (max 0.25 points):  \n- Deduct 0.05–0.25 points for substantial irrelevant or speculative content (e.g., unrelated molecular pathways, treatment discussions, or unmentioned evolutionary claims).

{"query": "Contextual materials: Bovines have long-been recognized as a key contributor to human schistosomiasis in Asia (Gray et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2006), and emerging evidence suggests they may be contributing to human schistosomiasis in Africa (Colley and Loker, 2018). Schistosomiasis is among the most burdensome helminth infections worldwide, with transmission being reported in a total of 78 countries in 2018 and approximately 230 million people in need of preventative treatment (World Health Organization, 2020). Although great strides have been made in the last few decades in global schistosomiasis control (World Health Organization, 2020), pockets of reemergent or persistent transmission highlight the need for careful consideration of possible local drivers of transmission (Kittur et al., 2019; Song et al., 2016). A poignant example is found in Schistosoma japonicum transmission in China, where despite well-established control programs and considerable progress towards elimination since the mid-1950s (Xu et al., 2016), a national report highlighted that there remained 450 endemic counties in 2020, a quarter of which had not achieved elimination criteria by year's end (Zhang et al., 2021). S. japonicum is transmitted by at least 40 species of wild and domestic mammals (Gray et al., 2009b), and animal activities near likely transmission sites may be important sources of reemergence and persistence. Although there are several domesticated and wild animals that can carry and transmit S. japonicum, (Li et al., 2015; Van Dorssen et al., 2017), estimates from Eastern China suggest that bovines may be responsible for as much as  $75\\%$  of human transmission (Guo et al., 2006). This substantial contribution is thought to be related to the high degree of environmental overlap between humans and bovines during agricultural production, as well as the large amount of fecal output of bovines, which is estimated to be as high as 100 times that of human fecal production each day (Gray et al., 2009b; He et al., 2001; Ross et al., 2001).

{"query": "Contextual materials: The silver homolog premelanosome protein (PMEL, alternative names: Pmel-17, SILV, gp100 and ME20) has an important function in pigmentation of vertebrates. It is known that the protein is responsible for fibril formation within eumelanosomes [1], and it determines the elliptical eumelanosomal shape [2]. In contrast, pheomelanosomes show no fibril formation presumably due to the lack of PMEL expression [3]. The fibrillary structures laterally assemble into sheets, which serve as a matrix for eumelanin deposition (reviewed by Watt and co-workers [4]). Mutations in the PMEL gene are associated with coat color dilution in the mouse [5], chicken [6], dog [7] and horse [8]. In cattle, PMEL function seems to be unique because effects of genetic variants are not restricted to eumelanic coat color dilution as reported for other vertebrates. The non-synonymous mutation  $PMELc.64G > A$  (NM_001080215.2) in the signal peptide region of the bovine PMEL protein (NP_001073684) is causative for the Dilution locus (https://omia.org/OMIA001545/9913/), associated with extreme coat color dilution in the Charolais cattle breed [9]. A three-base-pair deletion c.50_52delTTC also in the N-terminal region of the bovine PMEL protein is responsible for coat color dilution in Highland and Galloway breeds [10]. These mutations in the bovine PMEL gene affect eumelanic as well as pheomelanic pigmentation [9-11]. This is remarkable because in other species pheomelanosomes are assumed to lack PMEL expression [3]. Furthermore, the PMEL locus has been identified as one component of a complex interaction of three loci underlying the genetic defect \"rat tail syndrome\" (RTS) in cattle (https://omia.org/OMIA001544/9913/) [12]. RTS is exclusively expressed in animals with a eumelanic background. This genetic defect was observed in calves produced by crossing animals from German Holstein with animals from the Charolais breed. The calves have short, curly, sometimes sparse hair, and a lack of normal tail hair development. Besides substantial effects on the hair structure, this defect is also associated with genetically-determined variation in coat color; animals with the RTS phenotype exhibit a darker grey (charcoal) coat color than animals without RTS phenotype.\nquery: Although PMEL is generally associated with fibril formation in eumelanosomes, some bovine PMEL alleles affect both eumelanic and pheomelanic coloration.

Feline sperm cells are collected routinely from live animals by electroejaculation, artificial vagina or urethral catheterization (Zambelli & Cunto, 2006). Sperm cells can similarly be collected from epididymis and testis after castration or necropsy offering an alternative source of genetic material particularly important for endangered species of wild felids.

{"query": "Contextual materials: Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) Vif protein counteracts feline APOBEC3s (FcaA3s) restriction factors by inducing their proteasomal degradation. The functional domains in FIV Vif for interaction with FcaA3s are poorly understood. Here, we have identified several motifs in FIV Vif that are important for selective degradation of different FcaA3s. Cats (Felis catus) express three types of A3s: single-domain A3Z2, single-domain A3Z3, and double-domain A3Z2Z3. We proposed that FIV Vif would selectively interact with the Z2 and the Z3 A3s. Indeed, we identified two N-terminal Vif motifs (12LF13 and 18GG19) that specifically interacted with the FcaA3Z2 protein but not with A3Z3. In contrast, the exclusive degradation of FcaA3Z3 was regulated by a region of three residues (M24, L25, and I27). Only a FIV Vif carrying a combination of mutations from both interaction sites lost the capacity to degrade and counteract FcaA3Z2Z3. However, alterations in the specific A3s interaction sites did not affect the cellular localization of the FIV Vif protein and binding to feline A3s. Pulldown experiments demonstrated that the A3 binding region localized to FIV Vif residues 50 to 80, outside the specific A3 interaction domain. Finally, we found that the Vif sites specific to individual A3s are conserved in several FIV lineages of domestic cat and nondomestic cats, while being absent in the FIV Vif of pumas.

{"query": "Contextual materials: Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is a systemic fatal disease affecting mostly young cats (Pedersen, 2014a) sustained by the feline coronavirus (FCoV), which commonly occurs in multicat environments. The FCoVs usually inhabit the intestinal tract (feline enteric coronavirus, FECV). During viral replication within the enterocyte, a mutated variant, also called FIP virus (FIPV) may be generated (Pedersen, 2014a). Whichever is the exact mutation, FIPV loses tropism for enterocytes and gains the capability to replicate inside macrophages (Kipar et al., 2010). Moreover, FCoV induces macrophage-monocyte proliferation in haemo-lymphatic tissues and thus allow a progressive viral adaptation to the replication within these cells (Kipar and Meli, 2014). Although both viral biotypes (FECV and FIPV) can spread systemically, only the FIPV may induce FIP, due to the higher rate of interactions between the virus and monocytes. Moreover, the host immune response has a pivotal role in the development of the disease. Indeed, the cell-mediated immunity seems to be protective. On the other hand, it is known that the humoral response induces development of antibodies that enhance the in vitro virus uptake in macrophages and this, in turn, contributes in vivo to the development of the clinical signs seen during the effusive (wet) form of the disease.

FCoV associated with a fatal disease in cats, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), causes systemic pyogranulomatous inflammation in various organs, which subsequently progresses to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity and death. In contrast to the more common asymptomatic or mild enteritis caused by feline enteric coronavirus, the enteric biotype of FCoV, FIP is relatively uncommon in the general cat population, but it is the leading cause of death in young cats (1-3). In addition to the two biotypes of feline enteric coronavirus and FIP coronavirus, FCoVs are also classified into two serotypes, I and II. FCoV serotype I is more prevalent than serotype II, which appears to be derived from recombination with canine coronavirus in the spike (S) protein (4-8). Both serotypes can cause enteritis or FIP in domestic and wild feline populations, including wildcats, cheetahs, mountain lions, and leopards (9-11).

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory process involving multiple cell types and cytokines [3].

As the plaque progression continues, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) migrate into the intima and elaborate extracellular matrix. After decades, the fatty streak could progress into fibroatheroma lesions, characterized by the fibrous caps encompassing the lipid core [5].

{"query": "Contextual materials: Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (soluble) (PCK1) is a gluconeogenic gene that encodes the rate-limited enzyme PEPCK-C in gluconeogenesis (Hanson & Patel 1994). The role of  $PCK1$  in gluconeogenesis has been extensively reviewed (Hanson & Patel 1994), and it is well recognized that  $PCK1$  expression regulates plasma glucose level. For example, changing  $PCK1$  expression in the liver induces increased blood glucose (Valera et al. 1994) or hypoglycemia (Vidnes & Sovik 1976; She et al. 2000). Although  $PCK1$  has been linked to primarily gluconeogenesis, it has also been found in tissues that don't produce glucose, such as adipose tissue (Hanson & Reshef 2003; Reshef et al. 2003; Qu et al. 2016). Therefore, in addition to gluconeogenesis, other functions have been proposed for  $PCK1$ . Studies of the glyceroneogenesis have provided insight on the important role of  $PCK1$  in lipid metabolism. Glyceroneogenesis, which de novo synthesizes glycerol-3-phosphate from non-glucose or non-glycerol precursors, is a critical pathway for re-esterifying the free fatty acids released by adipose tissues during fasting conditions (Vaughan 1962; Ballard et al. 1967; Gorin et al. 1969).  $PCK1$  has been demonstrated to play important roles in this process. For example, She et al. (2000) found that mice with the deletion of  $PCK1$  in the liver presented a fatty liver because of the accumulation of fatty acid. Moreover, Olswang et al. (2002) reported that the deletion of  $PCK1$  expression in adipose tissue inhibited glyceroneogenesis and reduced triglyceride deposition.

STING is a membrane-related protein that contains four or five transmembrane regions, which are mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and partially located in mitochondria and mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) [4-7]. When STING is overexpressed in cells, IRF3 is activated and viral replication is suppressed [4,5]. RNA interference assays demonstrate that by reducing the expression of STING, the activation of IRF3 is inhibited and viral replication increases [4,5]. Bacteria and DNA viruses activate STING, but recent studies show that STING also plays an important role in inhibiting positive strand RNA viral replication [8-10]. STING functions downstream of RIG-I and MAVS and upstream of TBK1 and is considered a scaffold protein for the MAVS/tank binding kinase 1 (TBK1)/IRF3 complex when an RNA virus is infected and is capable of binding to RIG-I (rather than MDA5), MAVS, TBK1 and I $\\kappa$ B kinase  $\\varepsilon$  [7,11].

{"query": "Contextual materials: The interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immune response serves as the first line of host defense against invading viruses (Akira et al., 2006; Mogensen, 2009). Following pathogen detection and subsequent IFN production, IFN molecules bind to their cell-surface receptors and rapidly initiate a signaling cascade via the Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, leading to the induction of expression of a wide variety of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Kisseleva et al., 2002; Schneider et al., 2014). Upon IFN binding, IFN receptors undergo conformational changes and subsequently form dimeric or oligomeric complexes, which lead to JAK apposition and transphosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues, releasing their intrinsic catalytic activity (Levy and Darnell, 2002; Piehler et al., 2012). The activated JAKs in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domains of IFN receptors, providing binding sites for the Src-homology-2 (SH2) domain of the STAT proteins (Bousoik and Montazeri Aliabadi, 2018). After binding to the receptors, STAT proteins are phosphorylated by JAKs. Phosphorylated STATs dissociate from the receptor-JAK complexes, form homo- or heterodimers, and then translocate to the nucleus where they complex with other nuclear proteins and bind to IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and gamma-activated sequence (GAS) to regulate hundreds of ISGs expression (Sands et al., 2006).

{"query": "Contextual materials: IAV preferentially replicates in different tissues and organs in the host, and initial infection often depends on the linkage type of terminal sialic acid on glycoproteins expressed on the surface of cells. Viral hemagglutinin (HA) surface proteins bind to glycoprotein-linked sialic acid (SA) on the surface of host cells. The specific linkage of these sialic acids allows the virus to not only become specific to different host species, but also different tissues in these hosts. Humans express sialic acid  $\\alpha$ -2,6 linked galactose (SA  $\\alpha$ -2,6-Gal) surface molecules on epithelial cells in the upper airways, which is the site of replication for IAV in humans (Baum and Paulson, 1990; Couceiro et al., 1993). As such, strains of IAV that infect humans replicate in the upper airways. Birds, however, predominantly express SA  $\\alpha$ -2,3-Gal in their digestive tracts and lungs (Costa et al., 2012). Strains of IAV which are adapted to replicate in birds preferentially bind these receptors over human SA  $\\alpha$ -2,6-Gal receptors.

Chickens also have a predominance of SA  $\\alpha$ -2,6-Gal in their trachea whereas ducks have SA  $\\alpha$ -2,3-Gal receptor dominance (Kuchipudi et al., 2009).

Viral RNAs may be released from these apoptotic cells in intracellular acidic compartments, such as phagosomes, by the action of lysosomal enzymes, and TLR3 is the receptor for viral RNAs and is indispensable for mounting anti-viral innate immune responses by inducing type I interferons (Alexopoulou et al., 2001; Hoebe et al., 2003; Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004). TLR3-deficient mice lacked the ability to optimise poly(A:U)-induced clonal T-cell expansion and prevented the production of interferon (IFN)- $\\gamma$  and interleukin (IL)-12p40 (Sugiyama et al., 2008). TLR3 transmits signals through their corresponding adaptive proteins, and activates a series of transcription factors, such as interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, IRF-7, and nuclear factor-  $\\kappa \\mathrm{B}$  (NF- $\\kappa \\mathrm{B}$ ), which consequently leads to the production of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines (Sweeney et al., 2010).

{"query": "Contextual materials: Type I interferon (IFN) acts as the first line of defense against invading viral pathogens (Rasmussen et al., 2009; Schoggins and Rice, 2011). Once host molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as viral nucleic acids or proteins, a series of signaling pathways involving dozens of conserved adaptor molecules and kinases are activated rapidly, resulting in the expression of type I IFN (Akira et al., 2006; Medzhitov, 2007; Takeuchi and Akira, 2009). Type I IFN production during viral infection upregulated hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) expression via Janus kinase/signal transducer and activation of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway, many of which could directly kill viruses within infected cells (Schoggins and Rice, 2011; Theofilopoulos et al., 2005). In this pathway, type I IFNs binding leads to IFN receptors oligomerization, which triggers phosphorylation of JAK molecules (Cohen et al., 1995; Levy and Darnell, 2002). Activated JAKs subsequently phosphorylate the key tyrosine residues within the intracellular domains of IFN receptors, which serve as docking sites for STAT proteins (Darnell et al., 1994). Thus, JAKs in turn phosphorylate both STAT1 and STAT2 proteins (Schindler et al., 1992). The phosphorylated STAT proteins dimerize, interact with IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 9, and then form the ISG factor 3 (ISGF3) complex (Qureshi et al., 1995). This ISGF3 complex then migrates to the nucleus, where it binds to IFN-stimulated regulatory elements (ISREs) in the ISG promoters, resulting in the transcription of hundreds of ISGs to limit virus replication and spread (Martinez-Moczygemba et al., 1997; Schoggins and Rice, 2011).\nquery: Explain, in order, the key molecular steps of type I interferon–triggered JAK/STAT signaling from IFN receptor binding through to interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) transcription, specifying which proteins are phosphorylated, what signaling complex is assembled, and which nuclear DNA regulatory element the complex binds.", "response": "Rubric (Total = 1.0 point; Min = 0 points):  \n- 0.25 pts: States that type I IFN binding causes IFN receptor oligomerization and activates/phosphorylates JAK kinases.  \n- 0.25 pts: States that activated JAKs phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the IFN receptor intracellular domains, creating docking sites for STATs, and that STAT1 and STAT2 are phosphorylated.  \n- 0.25 pts: States that phosphorylated STAT1/STAT2 dimerize and associate with IRF9 to form the ISGF3 complex.  \n- 0.25 pts: States that ISGF3 translocates to the nucleus and binds ISREs (interferon-stimulated response/regulatory elements) in ISG promoters to drive transcription of ISGs.  \n\nDeductions (max 0.25 pts):  \n- Deduct 0.05–0.25 pts for excessive irrelevant content (e.g., lengthy discussion of PRRs/PAMPs or antiviral effects unrelated to the asked receptor→nucleus signaling sequence), proportional to severity.  \n- Final score cannot be below 0."}
{"query": "Contextual materials: The innate immune response is the first line of host defense against microbial pathogens. Various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play an essential role in detecting pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) associated with invading pathogens. PAMP recognition initiates an innate immune response, characterized by the production of type I interferon (IFN), proinflammatory cytokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (1, 2). PRRs comprise multiple family members, including toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and cytosolic dsDNA sensors (CDSs). RLRs primarily recognize  $5^{\\prime}$ -phosphorylated RNAs, including ssRNA or dsRNA produced during the replication of RNA or DNA viruses (3). Although RIG-I predominantly recognizes RNA viruses, the RIG-I/Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) pathway is also activated during infection with several DNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), Epstein-Barr virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (4-6). During infection with DNA viruses, RNA polymerase III recognizes AT-rich dsDNA and transcribes the dsDNA into dsRNA containing a 5-triphosphate moiety that activates the RIG-I/MAVS pathway to induce IFN- $\\beta$  production (7). DNA from viruses or bacteria can be detected by Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and potentially RLR, which potentially activate the endoplasmic reticulum-resident adaptor protein, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), to translocate from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, where it activates TBK1-IRF3 and -NF- $\\kappa$ B, resulting in robust induction of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokine production (8). IFN-I binds to IFNAR and activates R1-associated Tyk2 protein tyrosine kinase and the IFN-alpha/beta R2-associated Jak1 protein tyrosine kinase, which subsequently regulate the phosphorylation and activation of different STAT proteins; the activated STAT proteins homo- or heterodimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they promote the expression of numerous target genes. Binding of STAT proteins to either ISREs or GAS sites regulates the expression of several hundred ISGs, which mediate the anti-viral, anti-proliferative, and apoptotic effects of type I IFNs.\nquery: Describe two different mechanistic pathways through which nucleic acids originating from DNA viruses can trigger type I interferon (IFN-β) production: (1) a pathway that activates RIG-I/MAVS and (2) a pathway that signals through the cGAS–STING system.
