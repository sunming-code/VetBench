Which selections are consistent with established properties and research approaches for DTMUV?\nA) DTMUV is classified within the genus Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae) and carries a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome\nB) Because DTMUV research relies on access to its complete genome, transmission studies and epidemiological investigations are not feasible without live-virus vector challenge models\nC) An iTRAQ-based screen in DTMUV-infected BHK-21 cells has been used to identify antiviral host proteins induced by infection\nD) DTMUV-triggered innate signaling has been linked to Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) pathways\n\nAnswer:", "response": "ACD"}
{"query": "A researcher observes that IFN-β treatment rapidly increases expression of a deubiquitinating enzyme that both removes ISG15 from conjugated proteins and can dampen type I interferon signaling even when its isopeptidase function is disabled. Which statements are consistent with this enzyme’s described properties?\nA) Its induction by IFN-β is mediated through the JAK/STAT kinase pathway as part of a type I interferon-responsive gene program\nB) Its negative regulation of type I IFN signaling is fully explained by its ability to cleave ISG15 conjugates, implying dependence on ISG15 isopeptidase activity\nC) It belongs to the ubiquitin-specific protease (UBP) family, whose members share consensus motifs around catalytic cysteine and histidine residues required for enzymatic activity\nD) It maintains cellular homeostasis by efficiently cleaving ISG15 conjugates from proteins, thereby regulating levels of ISG15-conjugated substrates\n\nAnswer:", "response": "ACD"}
{"query": "A researcher observes robust IFN-β induction after transfecting AT-rich double-stranded DNA into mammalian cells. Which mechanistic events could plausibly account for this outcome?\nA) RIG-I directly binds AT-rich dsDNA and activates STING without requiring any RNA intermediate or MAVS\nB) RNA polymerase III transcribes the AT-rich dsDNA into a 5′-triphosphorylated dsRNA that activates RIG-I, signaling through MAVS\nC) cGAS sensing of cytosolic DNA triggers STING trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, where STING activates TBK1–IRF3 and NF-κB\nD) IFN-I produced downstream binds IFNAR, engages Tyk2 and Jak1, activates STATs, and induces ISGs via ISRE or GAS elements\n\nAnswer:", "response": "BCD"}
{"query": "A bird species is evaluated for its ability to both fly efficiently and pursue prey underwater using wing propulsion. Which observations most strongly indicate it faces the two principal biomechanical conflicts associated with avian diving while retaining flight-adapted morphology?\nA) It has hollow bones, extensive air sacs, and waterproof plumage that traps air, producing high buoyancy that tends to push it back toward the surface during dives\nB) It avoids the wing-design trade-off by keeping wings optimized for flight and relying exclusively on webbed feet for underwater propulsion while wings remain folded\nC) Its wings are large enough for efficient flight but become inefficient as underwater propulsors because water is vastly denser and more viscous than air, forcing a trade-off in wing design\nD) It exhibits reduced buoyancy because its bones are solid and its plumage allows waterlogging, facilitating prolonged submergence without active effort\n\nAnswer:", "response": "ABC"}
